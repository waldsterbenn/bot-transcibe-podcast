The challenge against 2050 is that we live in some connected systems, so you can't really allow yourself to fuck up. AI is not creative. AI is extremely creative and in many ways already more creative than the most creative people I know, including myself. What you're saying is that the tech giants will run with the win. This is Supertrends, the show where we inquire about all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked'm first born now and not 100 years ago, because then I was probably dead. It will also apply to those who are healed. In the future, in this episode, we will, together with our guest, science journalist Lone Frank, who, if anyone can help us, will see how the world's the world are radically improved by 2050. The human body is home to millions of bacteria. 90% of which we don't understand or know where some are good and others are bad for us. Bacta AI can research itself, it creates its own data set, designs its own laboratory experiments, interprets the results and then distill the findings in some way, so we humans can understand them and investigate them further. For, so that we can avoid resistant bacteria. And that's really crazy. AI can simply handle a range that we humans never get close to, like finding a needle in a haystack. Some say it would have taken people 200 years, others 600 years and others never. Lars, imagine if all this research is turned upside down, so new knowledge is something that is delivered by AI and then it's up to the researchers to implement and test the answers. All this big data and pattern recognition is totally stupid for AI. Yes, that's right. And I can't help but think about, if you look back at the history of innovation, then there have been all these different episodes where something has gone from being a relatively slow craft to suddenly becoming automated. The best known example was the Ford factories, where they suddenly started to make cars on assembly lines. Before that, it had been like, for example, sometimes when you ordered a car, the definition of a car was a chassis, a motor, a gearbox, etc. It was the technical foundation. But then you went to a car maker who made the rest in hand. And then suddenly you can buy these cars for a fraction of the price, because it is standardized. And in fact, it is happening within research that you are automating processes so that they run on a very large scale and fully automatic and 365 days a week and 24 hours a day. And that will of course accelerate our entire discovery process. Quite remarkable in the future. Are we ready for the timeline? We are. Super Transmaskinen is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives a clue to when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into play. That's it. And the first thing I want to start start with 2025. One of the prognoses we have is that self-controlled laboratories are used in academic research. A self-controlled laboratory is a robot machine. It is a machine controlled by artificial intelligence, which makes experiments all the time. And this artificial intelligence reads and interprets the results of these experiments, adjusts what needs to be investigated to move on. And it can run day and night and be extremely productive. We are now running to 2026, so there is something called literature-based discovery systems. These are systems where an AI looks at really large amounts of literature. Typically what is called paper, i.e. scientific papers that have been peer reviewed and so on. And a challenge for all researchers is that so much is published. And what these literature-based discovery systems can do is that they can read everything that is being said. They can have a hypothesis about the cause of a disease and how to treat it. Ordinary dead people do not have time to find out. But the computer can find out almost in real time. And then there will also be developed 2026 new algorithms to automate the design of scientific trial processes and product development processes. We all know about barcodes, which are on the goods in the supermarket. I make self-checkouts and then you use a reader to check the barcodes on all the goods. But we have something called barcode detection for species, meaning all the DNA that identifies all the different species on the globe. We have made a basic barcode system for that. And the prognosis is that in 2026, if you have a fragment of a DNA strand, you can almost in real time know what kind it is. If you know people as individuals, you can say that this was L a loan for example. Then there is something called transfer-based learning systems, and these are similar AI models that analyze data, but where they are made to look at data with one formula, but then discover that there is actually something exciting that is relevant for another formula. What do you call it? What do you say? It's called what? Transfer learning based hypothesis generation. It's a bit nerdy. So it just banks on you and says, you also have a colleague who is looking at this and it might be more relevant for that. So it suddenly sees some other patterns and some other breakthroughs than you asked it to. Isn't that right? Yes, and it's like the observant person who says, this is relevant for something completely different. And we have it a lot in innovation, where, for example, you develop some extremely strong laser cannons to make nuclear fusion in a facility in California. And then there are some others who say that these lasers can be used to drill a hole in the earth to make geothermal energy. There is so much of that in product development, and it is something you can do in research. And then, on the contrary of everything I have said, but specific to the next prognosis, is something called Big Data Science. You can also call it Science at Scale. You can also call it Science on the transport side, maybe. But There is something called eDNA and aDNA. eDNA is environmental DNA. It is DNA that is in an environment. aDNA is the same, but just where it is old DNA. So A stands for ancient, ancient DNA. So with eDNA, it will be expanded in 2027, that you simply accidentally swipe the environment. It can also be in ventilation, but also elsewhere, handheld and so etc. And then there is a running analysis of what kind of DNA is here. And it should probably also be for RNA. And then you can say, hold it up, it looks like there is one or another bacteria or virus that should not be here. And then you catch it very early. So it's like an over-examination of that. 2028, we have the first eDNA experiments in astrobiology. That means that you, on objects in the room, make a broad swiping to find out if there are fragments of DNA. Has there been life here? It can also be that there is there life here? It's probably relatively unrealistic at that time. In 2029, the IDNA is used in the white line to clarify crime. That means that instead of finding an object and maybe having the robber has been holding on to it, you just swipe the environment in general, and then you get a list of what types of people have been here, for example. In D-SK you can see that there has been one with red hair, two women, and so one had blue eyes. But then you can of course compare it with people you suspect. Then in 2031, quantum computers really start to break through in research. And then in the same year 2031, you will start to be start to make big data science on not genes, but on memes. That means you can put up microphones in different places and listen to how people talk together in their everyday lives. Just as you can see what they write on social media, but it's not the same. But from there AI can find out what the fundamental values are that these people have, that they put to the ground for all their thoughts and actions. Or the new word of the year. Yes, so you can make a statement about micro-environments and of course global environments and so on. I have many more, so I think you can probably stop me in a moment. So I just want to say that there is something called meta-analysis, and that is when you collect all the different analyses, qualified analyses made by a field, and then make a meta-analysis that says, what is the sum of all the knowledge researchers have generated about this? And this can for artificial intelligence, DeepMind. Here they have launched the tool GNOME to shorten even more unexplored materials, and in 41 days it has discovered new materials that typically take humans 800 years. It has been possible by using Deep Learning to analyze billions of experiments Lone Frank, welcome. Thank you. It was a timeline. I look forward to getting you in the studio. You have a PhD in biology, you are a science journalist at the weekend newspaper, you are a prized author, you are a podcast host, you are a debater, a lecturer. So I think we should talk about future research with you, because you have talked about some with many different researchers in your own podcast, 24 Questions to the Professor, I say, try to find a human equivalent of the Meta AI. And then I think, that must be Lone Frank. And how do you think AI and pattern recognition will challenge the traditional way of scientific practice? Do you see any changes with all the people you're talking to? I think it's very fun to sit and listen to all this Lars is talking about and also have read a little bit about it and then think about the enormous distance there is to all the ordinary researchers I'm talking to. Because far far far away most people have no idea that this is going on. And how could you implement this in your own little research box at KU or Aalborg University or wherever it is now. So I think there will be a huge difference in that there are some who are running away with this and who have seen it and they will come really far really quickly and then there will be a whole lot of people who just go into their own little room and produce something the same length. But one thing I also think about when I hear about all this, because it's very much the same. These different platforms are called something different, but it's about that they can do what ancient researchers should do. And I think especially that it will be a gift that you can put artificial intelligence to do a lot of that very ordinary, horrible research, which a lot of young researchers should go and do. And when we look at the research world today, when you look at the scientific world and all the literature that is produced, most of it could be done. Simply. So, some replicas of... No, and it's something that should be added. This PhD student should have x amount of articles about something, so that we can, you know, get a feeling that he can move on as a postdoc, etc. It's just something that comes to the research machinery. It's not research that will mean anything, also because no one reads it. Most articles are not read more than one. No, they are produced much more than they are read. Yes, yes, yes, yes. It's not even the mother of the researcher who reads it. It's just no one. What's interesting about what you say, Lone, is that young researchers are coming to us, who through their educational system, are getting this into the mother's milk. And we can already see that they are coming up very quickly and are feeding the talented people in the houses. And the fantastic thing about this is the offer to put machines to the rat-sick and let these people think. I think there will be a need for much fewer researchers if you use this correctly. And the most important thing is that these creativity of these people can be released. Research should be something where you think when you have the machines to do and in reality also develop potential new things that you can hopefully make a thought-provoking leap out of. So I think it could be a huge gift to research as such, out of all the nonsense and concentrate on doing something that really is thought work. Now you say that there is a need for fewer researchers. I think more with all the nuances of the world that are undiscovered, with all the diseases we have, with the huge expectations that the population has of both smart cities and smart health, there is so much to be caught up in. And because it's far from reaching these patterns and insights, to be able to deliver something that fits into ordinary people's lives or transport or whatever. I also think that something that might surprise you is that we've heard this timeline, it's tomorrow, all Yes, it is when the trendspotters are looking at it. They have read it, and that's why it is. And there are probably some places. You could read about it in Nature How, now something has happened in 2027, somewhere. But for most of us, it will not be reality in such short time after. There is also an energy in the systems we have, let's say the Danish health system. It will not be done in the course of 2027. But did not happen anything with Corona and the speed to the market? Has not there been a a cultural shift? No one thought they could find a job from home and then suddenly it was possible. I don't think you can stop from, you know, you have things like that. Something will always happen, also as we haven't seen coming. What is it called? The unknown unknowns But I think that in general it is a huge machinery that is also incredibly old in many places. So the fact that you just have a health system filled with old rules, well, those rules do not just go away with the same. If you want to implement AI somewhere else, it requires a lot of resources. I've been to conferences where it was about why we don't use the health data we already have. Denmark has an enormous amount of health data and registers and so on. We are the best registered people in the whole world. Exactly, we have all the possibilities. We could for the longest time have done everything possible in our health system, which was much much better. We do not test, for example, the treatments that are done, but do not follow up on the patients and then we gather it in an experience bank that says these people with these characteristics should not have this chemotherapy or they should have it or whatever it is. And that's something that already exists. It just isn't being used. So the fact that people are also a huge stop-close in relation to these things. I think it's the systems that are it. Now I'm sitting down there with transport. I have also looked very much especially at the whole shift from accommodation to accommodation and think about the citizens and the pre-building. We simply don't have the structures that finance it. You say it's expensive. It's very expensive to leave it be. But because you can't think in whole investment, then every silo sits with their their pockets and thinking, we can't overlook that. Yes. And here at home, you have a system like regions. We have five regions here at home. And you think, why? We are a nation that is smaller than New York City. And we have all these records, we should be able to run everything under the Ministry of Health. Why should we have five regions that complicate the system in relation to what is done in Holbeck on the hospitals there, what is done in Copenhagen on the state hospitals and on the Bispelbjerg. There can be completely different things at once. People who don't know what each other is doing. It's still difficult sometimes to just get data from a patient transferred from a practicing doctor to a hospital and vice versa. And before these things are done, there is an activity that you almost dream about. Something that can put a turbo on this development, if we now take the positive future hat on, is that so few people are born, especially in China, but by God also in Denmark. So if we have to maintain our welfare state, we have to think new. In China, they have made a health check. You go in, you are scanned by AI. It's like an old phone box. And then the medicine comes out of the dispenser, if you are to use it. If it is in doubt about what you are doing wrong, you go to the the doctor who will give you 12 seconds per patient. There is also something about the control system. I don't think it is about the Chinese system. But it just shows that if you want, you can change some of these things. Yes, yes, but you can do that if you had someone who just sat in a standing committee like they do over there and all of them are engineers and actually see the world as some blocks you can play with and make things more efficient and so on. Then you can just do it. But that's not where we live, and we are also one of those countries that has a high degree of success, one of the lowest degrees of corruption, and so on. So you can say, in the meantime, there is not much that speaks for us to change to the Chinese form of government? I have to suggest another form of government. It is the democratic one. And there is also something in AI. We have had for a long time, I have seen some times, some architect competitions, where I simply do not understand what they write. So architects write with architects, not those who actually live in the building. And there I can perhaps work as a form of translator, so that more citizens and interested parties can be involved in the research tasks and can actually contribute. Because I think one of the challenges is if you can't find out how to ask for help in your field. Because you get so nerdy and you get so closed up in language and reference frame that if you just knew what they lacked, it's just what you need. What you also need, I think, if we just take a place like here at home, is simply that someone who has an understanding of how to do these AI, how to train them, how to implement them as best as possible, train them as best as possible for a given area. You need a lot of them. And it's a bit like when you sit back and think, well IT people have always been in high demand. And just a place like this, how do our IT systems work? Hell yes. I think there will be a lot of problems and bumps along the way. But of course these fantastic tools can be implemented to incredibly brilliant things if someone really gets to work together. What I hear you say now, Lone, as a future researcher, is that the tech giants will run with the win. They are there in the whole world. They already have the data, because we deliver it daily. And we would like to share this data if we can live 20 years longer. So they bypass it. It's an interesting discussion. I recently did an interview with Sune Lehmann, who is sitting on DTU and is one of these exciting researchers who is quite diverse. He has actually graduated as a physicist and what is it called, and is, I mean, he has just built and published such a transformer model, i.e. a kind of JAT-GBT, which can take register data from the Danish registers over our, how should I put it, all kinds of things from different, i, people's registries, all these different health data and make it into some life stories and put them into a chat GPT-like transformation model and get this AI to predict things in a lifetime. And that kind of thing is, again, we are discussing, well, Hov, he said, this can be a gift to social science, you know, plan everything possible, you can predict everything possible, you can start to define your society much better in relation to who actually lives here, what is the need for this and that. Treat people in a different way. Yes, and I say, it can also be a personal oracle, this. If you get access to it, you can go in and ask as a normal person, what kind of psychotherapy should I have with what I'm dealing with now? MDMA or thrombosis? Yes, or something like that, hocus pocus therapist, or all kinds of other questions. And agreed that there is a huge potential for it. He would hate if it became another Google, another tech giant. Why not the Danish state, Denmark's statistics, etc. We could easily do that. So we lack, now we shouldn't be making politics here, because we say interesting, exciting in the program and is political, but we lack a common digital strategy that goes across regions and all, where we at the same time secure the data of the citizens. We have had a second one about Personal AI, which has this kin, and it is also the project that you want to hear all the insights, but without us getting any sacrifice. I give you that sacrifice picture, and it is something completely different, but if you are single and you're going to play at a summer house on Airbnb for the summer and you start your birthday and you want to play 1-8 people, you won't get any summer house. Because when you have to hold a party, and we don't like to put up a house, you get discriminated because you are in a certain category, out of some profiling that you didn't even know was done by you. You simply don't get the same offers as the family that comes in the right age group. That's the downside of this. Yes, but let's look at the research side. And what I started with, saying 200 years, 600 years, maybe never, can we copy it? Now you're talking about these researchers, who are some types who take it easy, maybe not the most extroverted of types, and suddenly they are torpedered out and get some insights. It is also what is called science, that they get some knowledge and insights, which they are not ready to have a reference frame, a concepts about it. It becomes very disturbing. I think so too. That's why I think it will take a long time before we can use these things and use it for something sensible. Just like would take, just like these researchers I'm talking to every week, can't just go and change their own mindset to, now we're going to use AI for this or that, or something they didn't even expect. It has to grow organically in some way, and that will take time. Lars? I think that it is a general observation in innovation that, as Jean-Peter said, it is not a matter of inventing cars. And making a process automation will typically not happen within existing structures, but it will be some new start-up companies or people who have got it as a specific task. Because it is very, very difficult when you are sitting in a state of routine and processes and have a way of working. Then you might think, that this can be done much more effectively, but you don't get it done, because it can't be done in that situation. So I really think you should think that it is other people who should come out and fix some things when you really have to lift it up on a completely different level. But Lars, you didn't have any questions for Lone, so now I will throw Lone out in 2050. Digital technologies don't just accelerate research in the world community. They also democratize scientific practice, for example through citizen science. It is an informal research branch, where medical people contribute to the collection and analysis of data through crowdsourcing, either voluntarily by themselves or on request from institutions that need empathy on a scale and with a speed they can't possibly match. The work goes from collecting birds in the neighbourhood to classifying distant galaxies. Participation can be either active or passive. For example by letting universities use the computing power on your home computer when you don't use it yourself. Something that is coming, and we have talked to Novofonden and the IT industry, is these quantum computers. And something they can do, at least that's what I got to know, is that they can check very deep, much better, much more orderly sources. There are a lot of errors in the AI we have now. So there are still a lot of check-ups and cells and all kinds of things to do. But when it comes, it should really come to its place scientifically. So it's The Missing Piece. It's about how we ensure that we can explain the context? If we stand out in the open and solve all kinds of problems, but it's not us who have found out, there is no living person who can explain anything. It's like quantum machines that have just thrown something out. What do you think will change the most towards 2050? It's likely that there will be a lot more information and instructions to people in all possible directions, which are not human-generated. And that you want to have gotten used to that it comes from something else, something that is bigger than us. Something that is bigger than us. Where the identity of the human intellect and thus also the collective human intellect. So an incredible amount of what will come down to quite ordinary people is something that is found out, generated by artificial intelligence. So it may well be that there are some people sitting somewhere and just saying a little bit about it and looking at it like that. But it will come from there and it will become completely normal and completely accepted. And I think that with the acceptance, which is often the biggest change. Because at the moment we are still in a beginner phase. And where you can sit and talk about this as completely natural. And if you go out on the streets or also into the university and down in the canteen, then it is not natural or you can not really overlook it. And it's like when you started the computer revolution, thinking that computers should be out of the big companies and become something that was personal, like everyone else had, that would go completely wrong. So acceptance and integrating something new in everything, in the way we think about and do things in our daily lives, is actually one of the biggest things. And then it will run and be used in all sorts of ways. And if it doesn't come from Denmark, and it doesn't, then I hope we are aware of the way the tech giants are making health, but also the countries that are taking it. There is Barcelona, Helsinki, they have made smart cities now. There are some who are looking in the finger parts. You could imagine. Now it is often so that you can see that within innovation, what is it called, a new breakthrough in science, and all tech giants are largely American. They are not European in any way. It could be that Europe started to think, in to think... I don't think we will be able to compete. We will not make big tech giants from Europe. But if you could start thinking politically and see how the hell you can... How can you make a development where we won't be standing and having our hair in the mailbox for one or the other Facebook owner or the people behind Google or something like that. I don't think that fundamentally, it's a position you can have, I don't think it good thing that there are very few people who are actually sitting and explaining. I looked at who the sensors come from. Lars was talking about the sensors that are supposed to collect our data if we want to have personalized medicine. That's Elon Musk who has the whole Starlink link sitting. And then there is the next one, what is his name? Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel, yes. But they are well on their way and they know how important it is to listen to these things. Now I would like to, because this is a little negative, and I would like to say interesting, exciting, and something that I think is completely crazy is, and we have had another program about it, with reading thoughts. And of course it can create a lot of conflicts in privacy, but imagine that we gather a lot of researchers about a really, really bad problem, you could say. Then it can actually read your thoughts about it. It doesn't have to be incorporated as Neuralink by Elon Musk, but it can simply see our thoughts in real time about it. So we don't have to do it sequentially or one by one, but we can bounce off each other and it can constantly make new hypotheses. Now these smart people together think that it looks like this and that, the model that is being drawn, but where there is also no room for individual thoughts. A bit like groupware, where everyone just sat and wrote in tact. But with AI that actually gathers and makes syntheses. Because as a researcher, you are also afraid of saying something that is radically different. You know that they get their heads cut off a couple of generations before they get rid of themselves. Yes, I think it's both the worst in research, but also something that can keep the most crazy things a bit off the hook. But the conservatism that actually exists in the human mindset is not always productive, in a way. But at the same time, it harmonizes with human nature. We are not not ready for a completely new society where you just walk into a box and ask what's wrong with me and you just go like this and that. It's very interesting that we are sitting here and discussing these things and we can quickly agree that that, it would be great and so on, out of the way with that. And then you just have a humanity that is not... There are twice as many, I mean, you are twice as afraid of dying than of achieving something, so we have this basic bias. But I must say that towards 2050, I hope that with personalized medicine, for example, will start to find medicine for women and their menopause and something that has spread to you, in addition to being made for a completely different target group. It's just really funny to think about. This has been talked about. I'm 57 years old now. I've been in this field for 25 years or more, and they've talked about personal medicine since I started. I sometimes sit down and get a reporter asking me, can you write about this and that? I have written about this for many years. Maybe a new iteration will come, but it is not that different. We keep on talking about it. We keep on having the same debates about CRISPR, which is a much better iteration of the old gene technology to make gene-specified organisms. Can we then find a way to use it? No! Because laws and everything else are in the way, and people's perception of this is terrible. It is, of course, also if we make a superhuman that can run a few kilometers. Yes. But that's what we're running into all the time. Humanity fighting against is a backstabbing risk. And that's probably also one of the evolutionary advantages. That we don't just do crazy things because someone got a really good idea and then out of the corner, like lemmings. Yes, we have done that, but then it's just been one who has run out of the corner, him who wanted to try to fly, or her who wanted to sail in a boat, or whatever it was.. The challenge with 2050 is that we live in some connected systems, so you can't really allow yourself to fuck up. You don't just drive your car wrong. If the autonomous cars go wrong, the whole system crashes. And that's also what can be a bit dangerous and the third step. So we're probably going to make some isolated examples. And one way to do it is to make some simulations, i.e. some digital twins of mobility or humans, so that we have these gamers who have grown up and say that it's just something we play. Now we're making this game where the rules look like this. How does it work? Can the world understand that people live to be 120 and walk around and grumble, but never die because of age or what it is now? So you take the experiments a little further than we say the same thing, no, we can't do that. It's very interesting you say that, because it's something you can already do with AI. It's within the research of society, that you can use AI instead of going out and asking people. You can just construct a number of people, as humanity has sometimes been put together. Or you can make special groups, and so on. Then you can ask them about their data. And when you do a check up on actual data, it's really, really good. But it's of course a problem to start asking people about something that isn't there. The data that doesn't exist. How would you like to be 120? Many would say yes, because they are now 30 and everything is fine. I don't want to be 120. When I look around the world, I don't want to be 80. At the same time we see a change, that we have a working are being cold-headed when they are 65. Two thirds of them would like to continue working. So there is ageism and something that doesn't fit together, where they say, yesterday I broke my hands, but... But you don't want to take back the hands that actually exist. Exactly. So again, it's the nature of man, and the human being we find ourselves in, and so on, I think is good. It always comes together with these artificial intelligences, which will optimize for one or the other thing. That's it. Then optimize for lifespan. Or you would like to optimize for personal medicine or something else, or efficiency in some context. And then it shows itself. Well, then people should also... No, then they don't think efficiency is the same as what they had. They they would rather have something else, then they would be too lazy to do anything. And there are always interesting, unexpected things with people. Yes, that's something I find interesting, that we can't find out why they don't want children. It's funny, because I don't have children, and the very simple answer to my question is no, I don't want to have children's families or anything. I want to be free of responsibility. I'm actually going to do a talk with an anthropologist in a few weeks. We're going to talk about weeks. He has been studying in China and other places. Why is it that people don't want children? Because it's not a fertility crisis. We can do all the children, but people don't want them. No. Because that's a life you've found out afterwards. You might not want that. It's just a good example, because we thought that the population would explode, and suddenly it's halved. And it's that with these problems that seem so unbearable, then something else happens. And that's where I also think it's interesting. Everyone writes these day-to-day articles about, no, the population is falling, we can't handle that, what should we do? It's exactly what we should say, cool, there are too many people in the world, we are destroying everything else. I've just been in Africa, there's no place for animals to live in the environment they're forced to live in. They can't live in cities, nests, etc. There's no place. Fine, but there's less people to live in. Peter Thiel says that there's a population of 10-fold, but we have to live in a huge city around the Earth. And then we make a green core, which is the Earth, which the richest can take to the jungle. That's fine. And I would say, there's probably something wrong. I would say, humanity has found its own solution. It's about getting as many children as possible. Now we're being pushed down to a smaller number, and then it will come at a certain point, then people will start to maintain the population there is, and so on and so on. But it will be all the time to get fewer people, and then we just say, okay, then we'll turn the technology to us and find out how to solve the problems that too many elderly people or something like that in this period of time. But if we go technology to find out how to solve the problems that many elderly people or something like that have. But if we go back to the 2050-loan, and something Lars talked about in relation to crime, is that you can predict who and how, and you can even predict it with this data. Can we in 2050 seriously start to predict the global challenges? So we thought, shut up, we were stupid. We thought that one was up and then it was down. And then there was both a crisis and then there was an upturn. I think there will clearly be improvements. Because a lot of things can be integrated into these big systems and you can handle big data and predict much better. Google can already predict every thing better than DMI, which uses physical lines. Google doesn't know shit about physics, he said, but they have an AI that just sits and has looked at what is being data and can predict the world much better than physics. So yes, I think we will be able to predict much better, but then again, I will say, because now I'm like the one who is representing reality here in some way, because that's also what I find interesting, that with research and with thoughts and so on, you can imagine everything possible, and then other things happen. And some that I think will happen is that we will have a war in Ukraine that is old fashioned, in a way that you think is a lie. It's out in the dust. It's Putin who just sends cannon fodder. Yes, but there is also a democratization. You use the technological platforms. It's fused with apps. It's fused with people who make all kinds of drones that run through the defense plants because you engage the local population. That's also fine. And the development of weapons is another thing. But you still have that old-time war. People are leading each other. It disrupts both economically, it disrupts many lives, you know. And there are geopolitical, what is it called, horrors are happening. I wanted to ask if it's researchers in the future, groups of people who make breakthroughs together, or do you still have that one Davinci Einstein? I think it's getting harder and harder. I think AI is not creative. AI only has the data and then they make something out of it. What is it that human creativity consists of? It consists of the brain, a biological machine, having taken and made a lot of data and then the unconscious makes and fabricates what we call ideas, new ideas. Wow, that just came to me, wow, big idea. That's also what you do. There is actually no difference. So I think we will realize that we are not that damn special. We have constructed something that will be able to do what we can and make it much better. And then we will also learn more about these things. And I think researchers get another role, which in reality often machine managers, that works with these machines as colleagues. And use it to upgrade their own thoughts and their own thought range. So I think this with a human brain can also, like an artificial intelligence, suddenly come up with something that is interesting and interesting, but it gets harder and harder. Lone Frank, thank you very much for being here. You're welcome. Future research is about unique challenges when discoveries made of advanced algorithms are to be commercialized. Because who or what is to be given the intellectual property if the scientific breakthrough is generated independently by an AI system? There are difficult questions about how traditional patent law should be adapted to meet the progress of technology. And the legal void we meet along the way risks hiding radical anomalies that occur in the meantime. Lars, the AI role in scientific research against 2050 will completely turn up. Will researchers of the pedestal force them to incorporate new tools? Avoid making the deep plate before and after, as Lone says, just because you have to publish an article, but really build on and train that wow, the creative part that we humans can. And then I hope that we get a much better understanding of the whole planet. But Lars, we're soon starting the moon round, so you should quickly finish. Are you ready? I just want to say that it is a huge subject, if we are talking about this. I can really agree with Lone, she said that we are not that special. AI is extremely creative and in many ways more creative than the most creative people I know. It is only the beginning and it doubles its ability every third month, and that also covers its creativity. And we have never started quantum computers. There was an experiment not so long ago, where a quantum computer made a calculation a billion times as fast as the best traditional supercomputers in the world do. And then there is something called Neven's Law, which says that probably computer power in quantum computers will rise about 65,000 times every five years. So that means there will be a huge, huge additional machine power in the picture. We go away from making many things in a very expensive and slow way. For example in medical analysis, if you want to investigate how things work on living beings, and that is called in vivo, it is very expensive and very slow. Then you can do it in vitro, where you might do it on cells in a petri bowl, but you can also do it in a silico, where you simply simulate it on a computer. And we are on the way there, where we can do things really, really well. A silico and like Moderna, when they developed their RNA vaccine, in a few days, gave billions of estimates to find out how to make this vaccine. Something that would have taken a long, long time if you had done it in vivo or in vitro for that matter. And we have Big Data Science, that is, mass produced sweeping science, which just finds out a lot of things at once. So it's huge and it's clear that in many areas the technology is overloaded by researchers. And therefore many researchers have to work in a completely different way to be relevant. But in return, they will surely find it much more fun when they do it, because my father was a researcher himself, and there was a lot of boring routine work in it. So that's going to be a mess, that's clear, the computer. But they can also come with inspiration that people can't come with, and we shouldn't underestimate that. I think we'll get more researchers. I disagree with Lone. We'll find out. I think the potential for access will be easier. It will be easier to get inside and start working that way. But time will tell. Is it nice to have or need to have this with future research? I perceive human civilization as a fly. In the way that if we stop the development, it will go to earth and there will be a catastrophe. It is very important that we continue to be richer and wiser and more sustainable. It requires research and development. So it is a need to have, in my opinion. And then it is slowly or quickly the question, and I just think it goes damn fast just before medical science. But it can well be that that there are people and systems that stop it all. The loan is absolutely right in that there is all kinds of energy that prevents it from being implemented, but it will just be new actors and few existing companies that are really good at implementing it. Is it easy or hard to invest in if you say that something is happening in research here, we get someone who nails it and goes to completely new places. Is it then just to find out where to put your money? The most exciting thing is to get start-up companies, because it sustainable, clever and super to us on social media. Remember to share and like.

Your host is future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrends, Lars Tvede. Welcome to the future. Jørgen Thorvald, you work with both medicine and preventive medicine. But I have an observation that you are very much into preventive medicine and you are also very much into all the new technologies that actually look like they work experimentally, but are not made for people who actually need them. And then you help people get started if they need it. Can you say a few words about that yourself? It is completely true that I am very interested in all new technologies. And at the same time I have seen as I get older that there are many things that we know but don't use. And that we need to combine the new and what actually works. And one thing that you discover with all the other things is that it is very nice to come up with new inventions, but if you don't use what we have and combine it it with the new, it won't be very effective. A good example is the new cancer drugs we have. If it is not combined with proper nutrition and motion, and takes its entirety, then it up with a lot of expensive medicine that doesn't work very well. So it is a form of both enthusiasm for the new, but also an humility about that we should look at the whole to get the new to work. And it is not always the new thing that is the solution, but that you are able to see the individual. And I would say that I am particularly interested in the reality of what we are talking about, personal medicine. Look at the individual more than the general. The function of hospitals is to treat as many as possible, as best as possible, within a reasonable budget. And where I come from saying, well, we should not find out how we can treat individuals to the maximum, because without going to the extreme and the maximum, we will not find out what we really can. I think we make a big mistake in our health system, that we never look at what the maximum we can right now, but rather we always keep the bar a little low, because we know it should be applied to everyone. And of course it is right that it should be. But if we don't look at the world of sports, if we never look at who can jump over two meters, then you will never reach two meters. Then you are always running 1.5 meters. So new technology for me and old knowledge should be put together and we should always try to test what we have and see what it can be used for. How long does it typically take for science to think that something is probably working, and that there are patients who actually get access to it? I think that's the big, tragic story for the health system. It often takes 20, 30, 40 years before something that we invented is implemented fully. It can go fast. I'm absolutely sure that there are some around here who are listening to this who will quickly point to some technologies that have gone fast. The Covid vaccine from Moderna. For example, a very good example of how fast it can go. But there was also a societal and political pressure that was quite enormous to promote. There was a clear incentive in society to have this forward. But if you look at the conventional inventions, it is a fight for inventors, whether it is a doctor or whoever, to get through the system, because there is no strong incentive for those who work at the hospitals or in practice to take in new technology. Why should they? They already work too much, they still experience their day-to-day being under pressure, and then they have to take a stand for some new technology that they do not necessarily think will improve their everyday life or working situation. So you don't go in and build a health system that promotes the implementation of new technology. It's all too slow. So the companies that develop it, they must have a large incentive, because they have patents that have a certain runtime. I can't remember how long it is. 20 years. So they have to get it out as soon as possible. But then those who treat, they have less or no incentive. And those who, the patients, they have, there is no rating system for music or anything like that, where you can say, that's not so good. So that's why the market doesn't work effectively there. There is no normal market mechanism that makes it possible for me to go to the US and get treated at a well-known hospital versus being treated at the best hospital in Denmark, the Royal Hospital or whatever, there is not a big difference between the two hospitals. Because within the medical science, you build on consensus reports and a method that slowly builds up knowledge. And the method development is simply too slow and ineffective. So it is possible that these 20, 30, 40 years before some completely enlightening new technologies are implemented, because it is too difficult. I would like to think together that I have dived into some areas that are developing excitingly and where maybe very good things will happen in the future. The very first is our relationship with microorganisms. We know the background, I can't remember how long ago, but it wasn't that long ago that bacteria and viruses were discovered. There was a period when it was thought that the body was sterile, that there is no one inside the body, that it is always wrong that there is someone inside the body, and then you find out that our digestion can not exist without us dying without them. And now there is an acknowledgement that both on our skin and inside our blood system and elsewhere, but especially there are lots and lots of microorganisms, bacteria, viruses, fungi, fungi and I don't know if there are others. Can you tell us a little about what you have found out in advance and then what it is you can imagine where we are on are heading in the next few years. Let's go back a step. The reason for the confusion is old knowledge. Sometimes we run too fast and think everything is new. But the knowledge we have gathered is a understanding that there was a source of water billions of years ago on Earth, a source of all kinds of chemicals and molecules that sw. At some point, RNA, similar to the early signals, appeared. It started to some amino acids and it started to produce some proteins. It took many millions of years, where they just started producing more RNA and more proteins. And then some mycelium, the cell membranes, There is RNA in it, and later on there is DNA, which is more stable. And then a certain chemical process is learned, which is remembered and learned. And then we start to get cells that eventually become multicellular organisms, and eventually become us. And from there we to remember that we are full of bacteria and viruses. That's where it all started. And then suddenly the assumption is made that we no longer consist of viruses and bacteria when we have built it from the start. And the next thing we suddenly forget is that everything around us is built of viruses, fungi and bacteria. It is a basic material substance together with all the chemical substances. And therefore the whole planet is connected. We are in connection with everything. Birds, animals, plants, everything is connected to each other. Yes, it may not move as fast as a plane between the different areas, but everything is connected to the whole earth. Therefore, when we look at our own universe, we are able to see it in the context that we are an organism with some bacteria and some virus and a lot of material. When the earth is doing badly, and it is on its way to getting it, then the human being also starts to do bad. And we can see that with the falling fertility among men and women, for example. We see different new diseases emerging. We see some different patterns in terms of diseases, how they move across borders and so on. So we are facing a paradigm shift, one could say, in the form of where our healing is going. And if we look at the microorganisms, as you asked about here, well, we have in our, especially our intestinal system full of bacteria, viruses and fungi. The reason we talk so much about bacteria is because we have technologies that make it relatively easy to measure them, whereas it is difficult to measure fungi and viruses. So we will talk about that a lot in 10 years or so, and then we will sit here in the studio and talk about all the viruses we suddenly discovered. They have always been there, but we just could not find them. So it is very complicated, in a way it is very complicated and in a way it is very simple. You can choose to jump between the complicated and the simple. The simple is that it is about a balance between all the organisms and cells we consist of. When there is an imbalance, we become ill. That's why it's not surprising that we suddenly become so surprised, and suddenly we have a coronavirus or something else. No, it's there all the time, but it's just to become a symptom of the disease. We are suddenly aware of it, but it was there all the time. So we have this microbiome, as it is called. Some have started to describe it as an organ, in line with nerves and liver. So if you eat something, it goes down to the gut. How much of the nutrition goes directly from the food into the blood and thus into our bodies? How much goes through these microorganisms? The bacteria in our digestive system are there to help us digest the food better. That's a big part of the reason for the cow, as we know, to digest the hard to break down carbohydrates. However, in our case, which has a shorter gut, we use it primarily to break down. Our bacteria are primarily to break down some of the sugar molecules and create short-chain fatty acids. This is where we are talking about the health-creating areas. The short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, propionate, valate, will produce these bacteria and it will be easier to absorb into the gut. We suggest that about 10% of your energy intake that comes from the process of converting hard to break down carbohydrates to short-chain fatty acids. We also have bacteria that specializes in breaking down proteins to amino acids, which makes it easier to absorb. You can still imagine that you have a completely sterile gut, which is the other extreme. What can we do about that? You still have a diet, it's just not that good. So you can live a while without it? You can live without bacteria, but it's not that good for you. You can't absorb all your vitamins and all the food you get. But we can give you some more of an astronaut's meal. We do that practically with nerve marrow transplant patients. Their blood is sterilized and they live in a period where they get what we call an inter-radiated nutrition, that is a nutrition through which we either take it through Sunday or we drink it. But there are always bacteria coming in when we pull the water or when we drink some water or whatever we do. But that is also part of the point, that if there are always bacteria that get in when we pull the water or drink water or whatever. But that's also part of the point. If there are some unfortunate bacteria, they get overwhelmed by all the ones that are there. Yes, and the other way around. For example, when you are on a trip to India and you are stupid enough to go and eat on a street corner somewhere, then you can be unlucky and get a massive salmonella or shigella infection. Is there anything with you even testing a new drug? Yes, I did. I went down to India to test what probiotics can do. If you take massive doses of probiotics, thousands of tablets you would normally buy in the supermarket, but in concentrated form in powder. Then you can shake the whole system out. The reason we don't use it medically is because it costs a lot of money. It's far cheaper to just give you an antibiotic tablet that rubs up. but if you want to fight it biologically, there are several methods. One method is the more coarse one, where you pour a lot of probiotics highly concentrated into you and filter the system through. More sophisticated, that's where we're heading towards hopefully. Where we use the baktophages, our virus, where we design a virus specifically for the salmonella you just got in you. And then you can be cured in that way. And then there are some people who are about really nurturing this bioflora, which was a country where you use bacteria to attack, where you use CRISPR, which is a gene manipulation technique to kill certain bacteria that you don't want, while all the others are completely uninfected. What are your views on these things? It's something we can do in the laboratory, but as long as we don't have a very small knowledge of the bacterial flora and we know absolutely nothing about our virus or our fungi and how they work together, we don't understand either. So it's like going in and throwing a hand grenade into a room and then closing the door and hoping it will work. We don't know what we're really doing. We're learning it and that's why we're living in a fantastic, exciting time. You read about theories that microbiome can be responsible for obesity, autism, depression, and all kinds of diseases. How solid is that? I think that the number of specific bacteria or viruses that cause a general illness for everyone, will go on and on. But there is no doubt that our microbiome or our intestinal flora can not be very sensitive to inflammation in the body. This is typical when you eat processed food, liver and are not healthy. We can see that there are certain bacteria that are sensitive to inflammation, not only in the intestine but also in the whole body. we can measure that today. We can measure how much inflammation you have in the body. So in that way, yes. But to say, to take the spring to say, well, it is specifically this bacteria or this bacteria that causes it, I mean, we're going too far. Because we have to think far. The interesting thing is that bacteria are constantly exchanging genetic material with each other. Via viruses? Yes, and by botting. They are sending and lie together and shoot each other. They can really do that. So they are out there, exchanging genetic material. Therefore, there are many researchers who work specifically with this field, who believe that it is not not relevant and interesting to look at which bacteria people have, but more on which type of genetic or genetic material is present in the gut. I will mention a side note about viruses, and then you have to hit me in the head if I say it wrong. In the human genome, we have found relatively long string bits, which come directly from other species. Some years ago, I read, there were at least 40 other species in the human genome. The way it happens is that something is infected with a virus and then it goes on into a human, but the virus divides itself inside cells and then they run around there and then something happens, they leave something genetic material in there, but they can also suck something and then it's thrown in somewhere else and then it's delivered and in that way there is not only a gene transfer within a species but between species and then you say, normally it's 99.99% really bad when it happens to you, but for the development of species it's great, because it's what makes the species develop. We're back to where we started, that we're talking about a universe, how everything is connected. Therefore, what you say is logical. There is a change between RNA and DNA, so the material between us. If you have eaten. In me? Yes, in you. In the blood. So you are what you eat. Yes. I think so. Then I will have to ask, do you think I look like popcorn? It's exciting. It's where the future lies. At the moment we assume that it doesn't mean anything. The reason we make this assumption is that we can't measure it. But you can philosophize about it. And that's what I do. You can imagine that everything has a function normally. There is a reason for something to circulate or exist. It always has a function within biology. And you can imagine that when you eat something, it will actually change something in you after many years. Gen genetically. How it happens is on one or the other method, but you can imagine that a lot of genetic material comes in through what you eat, what you inhale and the viruses you get, that we actually change. And that would make a really good sense, because we need to accelerate our selection pressure, or change. The genetic development. If it just ran completely slavishly, according to who survived best, then it would go pretty slowly. But then I have a question, because DNA is a gigantic molecule in comparison to all the others in biochemistry. So are there small bits of it that can be introduced into a single body via virus? Yes. Exactly. So there are very small changes. But we also have what we call epigenetics, in short, that you turn off or turn off some genes. There is not much to do about it. So in reality, I think a large part of what we will see when we start to learn more and be able to measure more and more about it, it will be that we will see that our food, there was actually a biotech entrepreneur I met a few years ago who told me and suggested that they had done an investigation about that if you drinking a glass of wine, and then you could see in the mucous membrane how certain epigenetic changes, i.e. some genes are activated or not activated against cancer. So I think we will get a shock in 10, 20, 30 years when we really start to understand what food and everything does to us. So purely technologically, how will we understand it? What technologies should we use that we don't have today? It's like many years ago, we only had a Petri dish. We put some bacteria on the egg shells and thought they looked yellow. That's why they were called Staphylococcus aureus. I took exams in that at Lapproth. Yes, you know what I'm talking about. And today we are in gene sequencing. But it is still a method that takes too long. What we use a lot in microbiome research is what is called shotgun techniques or 16 RNA sequencing. It is a specific way of going in and quickly sequencing. But it is still not a slow and ineffective method. In 10 or 20 years we will be able to sequence a whole genome extremely quickly. Therefore I think we will be much more confident with the number of tests we send in. I thought you could do it extremely quickly now? No, let me take an example from the microbiome side. The second you eat something and you sink it and it goes down in your stomach, the microbiome changes after you have eaten. And then you have eaten it and then we measure the microbiome after what you have eaten. And then you have eaten that, and then we measure afterwards with that. But then typically you don't get the same answer. You get an answer, some techniques can do it within a few hours, you get a small answer, you can still take 14 days before you get a full 16 RNA sequencing. It takes 1 week, 14 days, 3 weeks, depending on how much you pay for it. And that means that you can no longer remember what was it like to eat it. And that doesn't help us. We need to be able to get a response. If you have gone out to the restaurant and eaten, then you have to be able to measure with the same thing afterwards when you go to the toilet, what was it? And then continue to be able to measure it intensively. First you as an individual start to learn something about what I can and cannot tolerate. And if it plays on epigenetic piano, it is also a bit complicated to know what the effects are when it does that. For example, if you drink some wine and you get disposed to a priest, you are well aware of the effect it would have on my mood. but if we think positively and say that some changes are happening in my epigenome and I'm going to pour red wine into the swelter, but we don't know if it's a positive effect or not. We can assume that it is because we can see some genes being activated that are going in the direction of cancer. But we are not good enough to see what happens when you have drunk some water afterwards and when you have eaten some other food. What has affected your cancer? So the end result of taking a certain intake is not something we can measure directly. It will be indirect measurements. We see that those who have a high appetite have a tendency to eat badly. So we assume that this is what causes it. So you talk a lot about how much processed food is unhealthy. So are there any differences? I mean, you know that you shouldn't eat too much red meat, but a little is okay. But are there any differences in terms of health when eating a beef and a minced beef? No, there isn't. The difference between a beef and a minced beef can of course be the quality of the meat. If it's the same, it's just the beef that has been minced. So where are the problems with a lot of processed food? There are several. The first is that in the process of processing, the product is sterilized. Let's take an apple, if it is organic, it contains some bacteria that promote our health. An apple that is not organic, we see that the microbiome is different and contains bacteria that are more likely to develop inflammation. Is it because they have been sprayed with pesticides that destroy a natural bacteria and mushroom population? Yes, exactly. We are back to a balance. We are part of nature. And you go in and destroy nature, so to speak. So if you eat something that is not natural, it does not suit your body that would like the argument about high-processed food. You don't find it natural. You typically put a lot of things in a balance. High-processed food, you can see when be seen in the ingredients, so some of the high processed foods can be natural in themselves. But the processing process, the heating, storage, processing of and processing has made the natural substances no longer have the same conditions or composition as they did from the nature's side. If I now make an apple tart made of an organic or an inorganic apple. It sounds weird, but it's all organic. But then it gets in the oven and it all burns. Correct. So it's the same amount, right? Then you have removed the bacterial flora, so it's the same amount. And therefore you will most likely... there can be some pesticide residues from the one apple. It doesn't have to be. There are some who understand and produce apples, so it has a decent quality. So it depends on which hostorticulture and production methods. But a apple tree in itself is probably not the most healthy. It's a nice thing to eat, but it doesn't necessarily make it better.. You mentioned inflammation earlier, and I know that you have a leading role in something called SUPA. Can you tell us about that? We have always been looking for a method to measure inflammation in the body. It would be smart to measure infection. We have bacteria or viruses that cause us illness. And how they make us more ill. They irritate the skin and cause infections. Inflammation is something else. Technically we call it low-grade inflammation. It's where your immune system is always at work. It is natural that the immune system always ensures that bacteria, virus and organism work as they should and clean up your body. So it works. But the challenge is that if we start to smoke, for example, then we know that most people can't stand to smoke because the lungs react with inflammation. They start to rise in the lungs, get irritated in the lungs, you can't see it from the outside and you can't measure it in any other way. And then we havearker called SUPAR. It's a receptor protein that sits on the white blood cells and on the endothelial cells, that is, on the cells that cover our car and also sit in the lungs. When these cells die or get irritated and break down, this molecule called SUPA is released and starts circulating in the blood. It is a fantastic way to measure our inflammation. We have then found out that the more you have of it, the greater the risk of dying or getting a very serious illness. We have also found out that if you go and hold up to smoke, within three months you actually see a significant reduction in your inflammation in the body. Okay, so why is it a problem to have, I should say that all people have some form of inflammation, because there is something to fight with, no matter what. But why is it a problem to have increased inflammation? It is that, and for example the Covid situation was a very good example. We had a large number of people who got Covid and largely did not get sick from it. I know many who never even discovered they had Covid. And then we had others who became very, very seriously ill and came to the hospital and some of them of them died. And there are some really fine studies that show that when the inflammation was too high, when the super was too high before they got COVID, and it came up, then the fever went down. And it's simply the idea that our immune system has a certain capacity, it can store a certain amount of it. And if you have already been overloading it, then a Covid or another infection or cancer or whatever it may be, will come in and the immune system can no longer handle it. For example, we get cancer every day, from childhood to adulthood. At the same time, cells come and do something they shouldn't. Very oppressive. As we call it, cancer. Our immune system is designed to remove these cells. And it works really well. Until suddenly the immune system is occupied by something else. And then these cancer cells are released and can be placed in the body and then begin to divide up the nutrients. So it's like a restaurant where there is a lot of sterile light, but they are shut down every night, but then there is one that is not shut down and then there is fire in the curtains and then it's completely crazy. You can't clean it up. So it is important to keep your chronic inflammation down. But then we have another phenomenon, and that's where I get confused. And that is the Hygiene Hypothesis. And I have been very much involved with it for many years. In my opinion, there are many things that can damage you or can hit you in large doses that are healthy in small doses. If you have found out, for example, when you test for pesticides, if you have to find the maximum pesticide concentration that a person should have, then it is something with a thousand parts of what is hitting a rod in the gut or some other standard you have. But then in some of the measurements with animals, you find out that those who get a little bit of a gift, live longer than those who don't. And then you have found out that it is a bit of a stress, that it is good to get a little stress, and sport is also a form of provocation in reality, where you destroy the body a little, but then it builds up and becomes stronger. I have read two meta-analyses, i.e. analyses of radio-active radiation. It is something most psychedelic I have ever read in my life. One said that people generally need about 20 times or at least 20 times as much radioactive radiation as they get, and the other said that they use about 100 times as much as they get. And then you think, that's really strange. And then it says, I'm not quite sure why, but you think it's because it stimulates a genetic correction process. All of this is called homo-ice. Some say that you should eat half a kilo of dust or something like that. Or some say that you have quite strong evidence that if you have grown up in a slightly polluted environment, for example in a farm, you become healthier. At least you have a lower risk of asthma, allergies and autoimmune diseases. Then Lars Tøeder is completely confused, because if they say you should eat bacteria, you should eat dust, you should live in dirty environments, then you do not get chronic inflammation. If we now take the theory of hygiene, it is, just to sum it up, it is that the idea that we get to have bacteria. We used to live in a more balanced nature, where we got the bacteria we needed. The idea was that where we live, we get the bacteria we need to thrive. Then we have made our surroundings clean and the immune system no longer has anything to work with. It started in the allergy area, because we were keeping parasites in our gut and then we saw that those who no longer had all these parasites, they suddenly started to get some allergic diseases. So that was the way it started, and then you started to at it more closely and see that it is also about bacteria. But it is clear, and we are back to the same thing, that nature is full of bacteria and viruses, and most of them are good for us. And those that are not good for us are still good for us in small doses. So we are back to the organic, unprocessed, bacteria-infected apples that are good for us. For example. But back to the Indian we just mentioned, eating something on the street. The funny thing is that those who already have some salmonella and shigella in their gut system, because they have been traveling a lot, they will probably have a good chance of getting rid of it. Whereas I, who have not been in India for a long time and probably do not have a C. gella in me, I have a problem. Okay, but if we just stick to the infected apple, then the good thing about the infected apple that you get a more diverse culture of thought, but the bacteria are not actually being affected? Or is it good that it provokes us a little so it keeps our defense systems on the toes? I can say both. We need a healthy flow of bacteria in us to keep it all going. Then we need to be provoked, we can say vaccinated, I could almost call it that, by a virus or a bacteria coming in and creating some disease in us. And that activates our immune system and we are then vaccinated against it. So what is the difference between getting a disease and it being bad for bad to smoke. It is bad to smoke because it provokes us, but it also causes diseases. The problem with smoking, for example, is that most people can not bear it and it is because and they keep smoking all their lives. Imagine the situation in Africa in the old days. In one generation people had diarrhea all the time. they didn't think about that, it was just normal. But the problem with that is of course that you don't grow so well, you don't get as much nutrition and you have a lot of things, you get a little sick and other things. And the same here, when you smoke, you do it every day. If you just smoke once, nothing will happen to you. But you have single illness, you will be fine again. You will not continue to have that illness. Does that answer the question of sports training principles, where you provoke your muscles and then you restitute them? Yes it is. The body can like to get a provocation, but then it has to have the peace to strengthen itself so it can handle it better next time. Rebuild itself and prepare for, okay, it's obvious that he wants me to. He wants me to run far, then I have to train for that. Can you imagine a future where you have a much bigger understanding of what is ideal for each person? You have a combination of microbiome and you follow it like a dashboard, and then you can fine tune it. You need a little more of these organisms. Are we getting there, or a little bit, or where are we? It's an exciting discussion, whether it's the food that's actually just, that's what's actually on its way. I think that the food that is in fact on the way is the food that we put in. The bacteria and virus are secondary. I would rather have people inject their nutrition into their their stomach and thus create a microbiome that suits them. Then we have situations where people are decidedly ill and then you will go in and change their microbiome or do something drastic because then you have been pushed to the balance and then it is not enough to just eat healthy and then hope that you can restore your balance. Yes, sometimes we can do that, for example, some of those who have this IBS, inflammatory bowel disease, then we can see that we can get them back again and if they live very healthy and after what fits their level of inflammation. I also think we will see a number of different microbiome designs, as we talked about. There are a lot of biotech companies working on whether we can make a bacterium that produces insulin, for example? Or can they produce other proteins that work against inflammation? I think it's just a matter of going around the problem. I think there are better ways. Take insulin, for example insulin and getting bacteria to produce it. If that was the idea with nature, it would have done it already. I think you should look at what you can do for pancreas, the buccal cartilage, and make it work better. Can we talk about the about future pandemics? Now we have just experienced Covid and we can talk about our personal experiences here. So I had a little bit of antifungal drugs before the vaccine came. I got one shot and then I got another one. I was offered a third one and you told me that you didn't think I should take it. And you said it was better for me to get COVID. And then I got COVID and I had fever for 12 hours and the next day I wanted to go skiing. It was all fine, even though I coughed for a few weeks afterwards. How was your Covid? I did not choose to get vaccinated at some point. It was just a consideration that I have a very low inflammation level, that is, a very low SUPAM, which is below 2 nanograms per milliliter. And we know from research that it is very unlikely that, for example, COVID would make me very ill. That was one of my big anchors around this panic situation was that we have the technology to identify who is in high risk and who is in low risk. We also have an experience base. Most practicing doctors who otherwise know their patients quite well, will actually be able to identify which of their patients are at high risk and which are at low risk. And then with technology, we can of course make it even more close to measuring their super level. So that was my primary concern about how we handled the Covid situation. We did not let the practicing doctors identify those who were at high risk and those we did not need to focus on. But why would it be better for me to get the disease than to get the third dose? That's where we are in the speculation. We introduce a new type of vaccine very quickly. We don't have any experience with what it means to get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 vaccines. There is always a maximum at some point for every medical treatment, whether it's antibiotics or whatever we take. There comes a peak at a time when it's no longer good for you. So that's one reason. The other reason, and I think that Christine Staple-Benn, who is a professor and has advocated very strongly throughout the years for vaccines, has illustrated very well by talking about how all vaccines can have a positive and a negative effect as well, apart from the specific effect. And she advocates that if we are to be vaccinated, we should be vaccinated as closely as possible on a whole organism. That it is a whole vaccine. Here we have with Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, we go in and make you a production mechanism or machine, your cells to produce viruses. Can you explain that? The RNA, we go in with that vaccine and spread it into the muscles, typically the arm. We don't know exactly how wide the vaccine spreads, but we assume that it will spread in the intramuscular area. Right around where it is injected. Yes, right around where it is injected. And that's where these messenger RNAs go. I think we should explain that human genes are DNA. And DNA has a mirror image called RNA. But the virus doesn't use DNA, it uses RNA. And then you take small strands of RNA that are able to produce the proteins you want. And in this way you become a protein factory for a time. And why does it not keep up? Or why does it keep up again? It is because RNA molecules are unstable. So it is reduced quite quickly in the body. So it is there to produce vaccines in reality. Correct. And then it is produced and then it is gone. Yes. And of course, there have been some assumptions that in some cases it is produced within a certain time. And we assume that within a few days, a few weeks, production stops within a few days or weeks. The unknown is that if you repeat it many times, what happens then? Can it be that we begin to create a one-sidedness in the immune system? And that's what I see in some people. I take many tests and look at people's immune system at a very detailed level. And I think there is a tendency to develop a strong immune system against a very specific protein. Then a virus appears that is a little different and you are no longer prepared for it. Then you have to have a new one, very specific, to get it. The problem is that the immune system starts producing too much of something it doesn't need. That means, what if it doesn't produce? So it gets overstimulated? It gets overstimulated in one area. That's interesting. Let's imagine 20 years from now, when we have quantum computers and artificial intelligence, which is smarter than us. We we have, I know it's unrealistic, but we have learned both what went well and what went badly during Covid. But if we mobilize all that smart technology, better technology, plus the knowledge we have today, in 20 years, when there will be a pandemic that starts with people suddenly dying like flies somewhere and then we think, hold on, this is going to kill 500 million people. Tuhai, now we're going to start. What's going on? Now we're doing it right. What we can quickly see is who is being treated. We can quickly see the genome and the virus that is coming. We can understand what this virus can actually do. Which cells does it infect? How does it divide? What kind of... Is it primarily, for example, as we discussed, how deep down in the lungs? Is it in the nose or in that attacks you? Or other organs? Let's stick to that. With Covid, you were surprised by the attack in the kidneys. It took a long time to get a picture of what it actually was. In 20 years, with supercomputers, quantum computers and artificial intelligence, we will be able to make a silico assessment of all the effects of this. I would think it is reasonable to say that you could classify it and say that it is primarily a certain area of the body, the uterus, that is being attacked here. The complicated thing is that we are not all the same. Maybe we should go back to this. Why does it attack a special place? It shows in every single case that RNA-seq creates a virus that has a special form that makes it able to grab some special places. It's like a docking when two ships dock, they have to fit together, otherwise people can't get in from one to the other. There have to be some traps and something that fits together. And that's what the supercomputer does really well in 20 years. And that dogging you could see and say, that's typically the wave we have in the nose, where it really happens first and foremost. And when we know that, we know that if it happens in the nose is what causes the infection. When we know that, we know that the infection is in the nose, and that the infection is in the nose, and that the infection is in the nose, and that the infection is in the nose, and that the infection is in the nose, and that the infection is in the nose, and that the infection is in the nose, and that the infection is in the nose, and that the infection is in the nose, and that the infection is in the nose, and that the infection is in the nose, that affects especially young people or older people? What is the problem here? We were lacking that. When Covid came, we were in a state of uncertainty. Where does it affect everyone? But you can always assume that if you have low inflammation in your body, you will be better off than if you have high inflammation. If you are born with Ebola, it will probably affect a lot of people. It will still affect a lot of people, but still those who will cope better are the ones who will most likely have a better source of income. How do you find out if it has spread to the planet? It is also an area that we could have prepared ourselves for, but it is also best method of measuring our running water from the toilets. And then you can measure the different cities very quickly and see how it spreads. There is also something with people who start searching for specific words on their phones. Yes, that is the other way around. People who are starting to get symptoms are starting to search for those symptoms. And then you can quickly track the spread of the infection. You can also do it as a regular test. You can do a collection of air tests and whatever you want. But it's all very expensive and difficult today, but you can imagine a future where you measure the quality of the air in all the places where many people pass by. And that will be really exciting, because then you will be able to see, when there are certain patterns of viruses, for example, then you will be able to assume that now there is probably a new influenza virus on its way, for example, because now there is room for it. So you can measure the whole picture of all the viruses that circulate, and you can say that there is a hole in the ecosystem. Yes, exactly. And it's not because the virus has a desire to fill it all, but because if there is a hole in someone who doesn't circulate now, then there is no resistance force if it should come. So therefore, collectively, I'm starting to see a nasal control room dashboard, where you can say that collectively humanity is in danger zone if a type of virus appears. Quick question, Spanish flu, the Spanish disease that was under the of World War I. The 18th disease. Yes, which, as far as I remember, killed more people than the war itself. It killed more young people, and that's because of the excessive immune reaction. Is it still there? Yes, it is still there, but of course it has mutated to become something else. But the root family is is still in other forms of viruses. But let's go back to the reason why many men died. It was because they had been in war. They were weak. So all these strong soldiers who had been there, they were weak and therefore easier to sacrifice. I think that if you had had a Spanish patient today, I'm not sure it would have gone the same way. We would have seen a greater mortality rate among the elderly and a lower mortality rate among the young. I don't think that was necessarily the case. But that is something that we will discuss in the future. But back to how we react to whether the Spanish virus still has. No, the specific Spanish virus is gone. It's a sub-species. So it's mutated into something else? It disappears. It dies out in principle. Nature always generates a new virus all the time. They are constantly evolving and disappearing. There are billions of species. And they change all the time. But the families are still there all the time. But the nature experiments on itself all the time. now I have a question. When there is forest fire, fire on a prairie, then you have a technique where you make a controlled fire. For example, there comes a huge forest fire towards a building, then you start a small fire right in front of the house, so you fire is gone. If we now notice that there is a terrible virus that has spread from China, then we think that it is then we think it's about infecting as quickly as possible with something that is very similar to it so they can build up immune defense. Is that different from a vaccine? No, in reality it is the same. I'm thinking of the virus, it infects you individually, but if you now release something loose that spreads itself. It would be extremely elegant. The day we really understand the whole thing, then we could do it. They could be much smarter than to start lining up people to get vaccinated. It's too slow and ineffective. A virus could do it much faster. It would go viral, as they say. That's what they're good at. So what you're saying is that if the next time there is a serious pandemic, you should test people for their super to find out how strong their immune system is. You have to investigate which types of people it typically harms and where in their body it typically harms and what the course is typically. But you also have to test for others to do individual treatment. I would like to add that one should of course be more careful that one health system works. That was completely radical, I had not thought of that on my list. The biggest reason for the many deaths is that people do not have proper access to a good health system. Denmark has been fine in that we have had a very low mortality rate as a result of COVID. Whereas we have seen in Italy and the USA, where there is a very high mortality rate and there has been poor access to health. And then of course also a population that has a poor health condition. And that's the second part of the pre-existing. Why is it that viruses hit especially hard in the winter season? I must say that Italians don't have a particularly bad health status. Unfortunately, it has happened for Italy that they see an increased weight, there is a higher degree of diabetes and weight gain in general in Italy. So that's one part. The good old Mediterranean food has disappeared and has been taken over by high-processed food. They have already had the same problems as we have seen in the USA and other places. So the Italian population is no longer as healthy as it is now. It's not as bad as it was in the cities. But the important thing is, why did the Danes stop doing good? Because the moment someone got seriously ill, there was no way to get to the hospital. We were good at getting people in quickly. Whereas in Italy, people were allowed to wait longer because they didn't have the same opportunity to get to the hospital. Could you give people some body trackers that in some way would set an automatic alarm? Exactly. Take the future epidemic for example. If we know how the disease will develop, and we would know that by looking at the technology we will have in the future, then we will know what to look for. And then we will be able to say, well, if you get the temperature and have these blood parameters, or what we are testing now, or have so many viruses in the body, or what we are measuring, or what we measure. Then an alarm clock rings and says there is a class for you. Next week you will be very sick, so you need to have a treatment. It can be some antistaff or something else we give you. And then we can send you home again. So the whole idea with the future hospitals and the future health system is that people should not become so ill that they are admitted to a hospital. It is really a failure from an optimal health point of view. So with Covid, there designed the RNA vaccine, which was something that was talked about since the 90s, but never launched commercially or maybe could not have been allowed to. But they developed it in 48 hours and tested, I don't know if that's correct, but billions of different variants. So it's simply a computer that simulates billions of variants in two days and then says this is the best. And then it 10 months, and that's because you have to do clinical tests where you start with a very small number of people. I don't know if you test it on animals first. So it takes the time it takes. But if now, let's say it's more serious than COVID, like airborne AIDS, or something like that, and you just have to go out, can you then simulate in a computer the effect on people with all kinds of different circumstances, and then say, we simulate billions of potential people and then we let them go after a week? We can't do that today, but it's clearly a future scenario that we can imagine with artificial intelligence. We're starting to collect so much data that we're learning a lot more about the different clinical trials, because we will be able to collect more data and understand more data at the same time. The ultimate scenario, which Moderna and Pfizer have been talking about, is that we see that a virus is on its way, we create a vaccine that matches it quickly and that will be okay. Where I am a little worried is that I love all new technology, when you hit something very specific, you also increase the risk of hitting something very close to it. And that's what I think the technology is still not fully developed. It went well this time, but it's not certain that it will continue to do well. That's why we have to be a little careful in today's time. But in the future scenario, it will be clear that we will identify a virus and then we will be able to evaluate whether it is a good idea to develop a vaccine. And in other cases, we will say no, there is no reason to do that. Let's take for example the swine flu vaccine or the swine flu vaccine. Denmark not decided by Denmark to vaccinate against. And that was a really good choice we made. We were one of the few countries in Europe that chose that. And that's a very good example of how sometimes it's a good idea not to vaccinate, and other times it is a good idea to vaccinate. But what you primarily say is that you must mass individualize, that is, you must test people for their condition and find out whether they should be vaccinated and if so, how much. And what you say is that when you say it went well, we all know the data that says some people got sick from the vaccine, but there were also some people who got sick from not getting the vaccine. So under the balance it was a good thing that the vaccine was available and the overall consequences for humanity would have been much worse if it had not been. But if we have much more precise information about each individual, then we can medicinate individually much better. And then you say that the downside to getting too much vaccine is that the body is too focused on fighting one thing, and that goes beyond its broader spectrum of defense readiness. So then I have a question. Some say that you expect to get a general influenza vaccine. So it covers all sorts of things. Can you do that? And how? It's just a matter of time. We have to remember that vaccines mutate all the time. The basic idea with the general vaccine is that you imagine that you can go in and find points on the virus that is general for all viruses. The problem is that you will probably also hit some of the viruses that are actually good for you. And we have done a lot of research into which vaccines that are very similar to an influenza virus or maybe are an influenza virus that just no longer have any meaning for you. We don't measure that. How can they be good for you? Again, it goesates your immune system. We don't understand the ecology in it. We don't understand the total connection. It's like in the old days when we poked antibiotics on people and then said, it wasn't so good that we gave it to everyone. And the same with vaccines. I think a general vaccine can become a disaster. Because we have excluded an area, just as we did with antibiotics. And then we see, that was not so good. But is it in this way collectively that there is a vaccine resistant virus or is it on the individual level that one person lacks some good virus? I imagine more that you remove an ecological area. What will come out of it? Is it Ebola or something else? We have no idea what is happening. At the moment we have no idea if it is good or bad when we remove something. So it good or bad? Ok, so we need to have a clear picture. You have bacteria, there is something called faeces. It is also a virus, but they just prevent bacteria. They attack bacteria. They sit outside and regulate. In reality, they are not often affected by the bacteria, but they just reduce their efficiency. They can screw up and down for the bacteria. Which then gives time for the body to better control them. Yes, or maybe the body has a communication with the faeces, we don't know, that then tells us that now we have to screw up and screw down for the bacteria. Like there are herons in the zoo, because otherwise there will be too many predators and such To sum up, there is a possibility to make a preventive infection, a preventive virus, to create an immune system much faster than vaccinations can do. There is a possibility to measure supra pressure, there is a possibility to measure the anti-stress situation, there is a possibility to go out and ask the doctors which of their patients they think are in the danger zone. There is a possibility to investigate where it has spread by looking at, i.e. measuring whether there are these gene strands in the clorox. There is a possibility to look at the gene lines in the clots, what people are saying on their phones, etc. to find out what it is. There is a possibility to measure beforehand, but also when it is in progress, what kind of viruses are in the air around different places. That's another interesting topic. You can imagine that there are some unfortunate combinations. We don't know if there were other viruses that circulated at the same time as Covid. That made Covid become even worse for us. It's so-called co-morbidity. Yes, exactly. Co-virus morbidity, whatever we want to call it. So we lack all that ecological understanding. And that's why I'm very reluctant to go out and vaccinate aggressively or do something else before we get a better understanding. Another good principle, because I was doubtful about vaccinating many times, was that we had measured how many antibodies you had. You had a lot of antibodies against COVID. And then start giving you a vaccine that gives you even more than you already had, does not make sense. And it is really against our vaccine process and principle. It was that we go in and vaccinate when people need a booster. Yes, just enough, not more than just enough. That means we measure first, do you need a booster? And it is to be against the regimes we have set have set up, it's like a pair of automatic machines that just says everyone should be boosted with three or six months without measuring whether they really needed it. And without checking that they are, because many of those who we have re-vaccinated, they have actually had COVID themselves.. So beyond their vaccine, they got COVID. So they got a natural vaccination, you could say. And then you go in and vaccinate them again. So you start creating an enormous amount of antibodies against one disease. So you can measure super, i.e. the general level of inflammation, you can measure antistoff for the specific disease and you can measure if people have the disease. If you now say that you have to do all three things in million-signature test? Is there a significant difference in the cost of the three tests? Yes. If you scale it up, then all the tests we are talking about real price difference when you think about it. I'm just asking because sometimes when we discuss technology we talk about the different economic phases the world has gone through. The industrial age started around the 1800s and still exists. It is about mass production. One-sided mass production. Then came a layer called the precision economy, which is based on computer technology, telecom, which is also a computer, and then on very advanced precision biochemistry. And then we are on our way to hyperintelligence where computers can analyze extremely extreme amounts of data and come to conclusions. So it sounds a bit like this mass of forced vaccination, or almost forced vaccination, most extreme we saw in China, saw the collapse of a society for a very long time. It is the industrial economy's instincts that are at work. So the precision economy, where you go in and measure each individual person. What do you need now? What is it right for you now? And that was not really what you did. But that's what we did. That's what you did for me. And then the next is the hyper-intelligent economy, where you also use computers to quickly get a very will do in this case. But they can also simulate, as we have seen from Covid, that it mutates to a lot of other things. They can also simulate what it is likely that this will become, delta, omicron, etc. And how should we react if that happens? And for example, now I come to think about it. Omicron was a gift from heaven. We had a little collaboration to find out how it worked. And when you told me that it seemed more harmless than normal influenza, I thought, God, we should put it in the water. Let's see if everyone is immunized now that we haveharmful. Who knows if there will be a dangerous one after that. It hasn't been done yet. But in principle, we could also use a preventive, if we have Covid, it is quite dangerous. Or we have a sub-version now, but we can make a variant called Omicron, which makes people immune and then we spread it in society. I think that when we land, at some point, it will be, but you can also call it a vaccine, it's just another way of vaccinating. It's a viral vaccine. It's not a virus vaccine, it's a viral vaccine. So it's a biological crisis prevention. It makes good sense because it's cheap and effective and it will also spread to those who need it the most. The challenge with that is of course how do we ensure that we understand how the virus develops and so on. You take a risk, of course. You can of course say that if there are people who die from a mutation of the virus, then you can imagine a certain amount of palladium. There are some ethical things to look at, but the interesting thing about the future is that the probable probably solve many of the problems we have here. I think we should look back on what we have done as primitive. When we understand the whole, what we did before becomes very primitive. Yes, so besides all these technological solutions we are talking about, there is a very big communication problem with getting the public and all kinds of other actors to become more aware of what is optimal to do with the technologies you have and will have. We are used to doing things in a certain way and thinking in a certain way, as you mentioned the industrial mindset. And then suddenly we have to switch over. One of the big challenges I think we face with artificial intelligence is that we are facing a situation where there is a machine that can collect an extreme amount of data that we would never have understood ourselves. And to be able to explain things that we would never have done ourselves. Yes, you work on making software that can understand what the world is doing, but it is often so complicated that it requires another art form to translate it into the other language we stupid people are able to handle. And it's a bit like what you see with viruses and bacteria. It's extremely complicated, that's why we can't understand it yet. But with the new opportunities that are coming, we will suddenly be able to see some patterns in this very complicated picture. Thank you very much for talking about it.

The first thing that really confused me was how early hotels in Europe come. Everything we find in our solar system is made the same as what we have here on Earth. The only challenge is that here on Earth they are much deeper down under the earth's crust than they would be out there. And the counter argument you hear is that if they are not allowed to take the resources, then no one will ever come. The hardest thing right now is to find out how we survive on Mars. This is Supertrends, the program where we inquire about all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsøe, and every week she is flanked by investor just about discovering new planets or finding new life, which we will also make make a program about, but also to push to our own limits as an art and have a backup plan when our planet runs out of resources. But will the room be more of all people's property or will it end up in the hands of a few ultra rich people? This time we have two guests to help us with the room, both as an investment and a resource that we hopefully find out how to share. Lars, before I start, I have to say that I have talked to the Berlingske house here and 24-7 will close on April 1st. Thank you very much to all of you listeners who have tuned in. Remember to share and like, because if we get to those 50,000 per time, then we are completely sure to continue after April 1st, when 24- July closes and closes. So that was a quick message that I will never make. Back to the room, Lars. We might have to do super trends from there at some point. But it's something else. Starry sky, we look at. you are, Eva Bjerg, thanks to all the satellites that are being sent up. It's crazy. Can it just keep going? It's clear that now we've started to navigate around the universe and use the opportunities it gives to everything that has a great commercial and social meaning. I can't see anything other than that it is the beginning of something that will continue. And of course, it has developed in a slightly different direction than you might have imagined in the late 60s, early 70s, when there were some who landed on the Moon sometimes. And then I thought, well, that's about living on the Moon, living on Mars. But what has become much, much, much bigger is satellite communication, which plays a completely central role in our daily lives. Just to mention that it starts with satellite TV and telecommunication via satellites, but GPS, the ability to navigate precisely around the center of Milan in the middle of the night, or find your way out of a forest where you don't know where you are. We only have that now because of the satellites. So it's a form of critical infrastructure. For me, this space shuttle has also been a picture of the Cold War. And now we are on our way into a new geopolitical situation, where I just read that the Russians use 40% of their income on the defense. It is simply a military economy, and we will probably see that in relation to some of the efforts that are just to occupy the room. Yes, so there are many who prioritize being strong also in the presence in the room, both for civilians and for the military and then for national prestige. I heard it from the very David Trest, who has the security program. He said that it was exactly what happened before the Soviet Union came to a decision. So now he's just waiting for the economic crisis to come in 12 years. That's very possible. Shall we jump in the timeline? Let's do it. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives a signal of when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. That's right. I've looked at some of the many predictions we have in the room. The first thing that really surprised me is how early the hotels in the room will be. There are actually predictions that they will be here this year. You have to sleep somewhere else. You and I, Lise Lotte, can sit together with some guests in the room and make supertrance programs. I just want to hear, there was a dog, Laika, that roared in the room. Can you be a dog in those hotels? There shouldn't be any way around it. There is a company called Worldview Enterprises, which works on a hotel balloon. When it's a balloon, you don't think it's out in the room. And it's technically not. I don't know the definition. It's 30 km up. It looks like you're outside the atmosphere when you're so high up. they have a project with a balloon for eight passengers, which will be a room hotel. There are others called Space Perspective. They also have one for eight passengers. And then there are some called Near Space Tourism, which will have 22 passengers again at a height of about 30 kilometers. So that's something that's starting. And of course, it's not the same as living in something that rotates freely in the room. It's a balloon and it depends on the atmosphere that it can move up and down through. But But it's relatively simple technology in reality, so it makes it easier and it doesn't require a lot of energy to send it up and down. So 2025, it's soon, there are some working on making 3D printed rockets. And the advantage of 3D printing is that it often reduces the costs. We have already seen SpaceX reduce the costs of selling rockets by at least 90%. But with 3D printed rockets, you can bring it even further down. Then we have 2027. There is expected to be a plane flying around Mars. It is not a very large plane, it has a wing span of about 60 centimeters. We have a lot of predictions for different means of production of rockets, and some of them are based on nuclear power. I'll just say as an example that China expects to launch a rocket based on that in 2030. And then in 2035 there is a prognosis for building infrastructure for accommodation. And it will be 3D printed. And that will happen in the room, that is, on the moon. 203535, you expect to start growing vegetables, maybe even fruit, where you use the astronauts' urine. I have heard to this level that our lovely earthenware is never dry for resources. So I doubt that there would be a lot of economic point in storing resources in the room to bring them home to earth, simply because it would be very expensive. But you also need to use resources in the room for what you do in the room. And I personally believe in that a lot. And there is a prognosis for 2035 that says that you will start producing methane on Mars and then use it as fuel for rockets that will fly from there, plus other things on Mars. And then in 2035 there was also a expectation that a permanent human... what is it called? Reservoir, you can call it, in a space vehicle that rotates around the moon. And then in 2037 they begin to build a plant is built on Mars to have a stable energy source there. In 2045, advanced industrial production begins in the room. in the room, it is typically on a planet where you use the resources on the planet or on a moon. And then we have in 2045, you start to have room tourism outside of these balloons, where people decide to take a room ship and live there as a hotel. In 2050, there will be land use on Mars in a larger style. And in 2060, you have a colony on Mars that has become completely independent of anything from the globe, that is, it is totally sustainable in reality. So those are some of the prognoses, and it just shows a expectation that we will get further and further out in all possible tangents of exploiting the rooms. For decades, plans for the construction of a luxurious hotel that can accommodate guests about 400 km above the surface of the earth. Most of the designs are about a round Paris-suit, about 200 meters in diameter, where guests either live in the rooms they have come to, or where the whole circle is an all-round common area with connected permanent buildings, and the middle of the circle functions as an arrival and departure terminal. But only professional astronauts are trained in keeping themselves in the open. Civilians need gravity, and the Cirkel Hotel creates that by rotating around itself with about one full rotation per minute, while the whole hotel circulates around the earth every 19th-20th minute. This will give a kaleidoscopic view of extraordinary views, but also create a constant shadow play, which gets the clipped sunbeams from windmills to remind us of pleasant lighting. And I have two fantastic guests. First of all, Cecilie Sand Nørholm, you are an astrophysicist at Planetarium in Copenhagen. Welcome. Thank you. And then I have you, Hjalte Osborn-Fransen. You have a PhD in Space Traffic Management from Texas and Copenhagen University. Welcome. Thank you. Hjalte, if I start with you. You talk about three big trends in space. Expansion, security and privatization. Can you elaborate on that? We have already been a bit into it, but for me to see, the big macro trend is this enormous expansion. We have gone from sending very few satellites up until 2017, where we never sent more than 200 satellites up in the first 50 years. Last year we were around 3000 and we are looking at something that looks like a doubling every other year. So it is a very intense expedition. If we look into the international telecommunications register and registered satellites over the next decade, then it is a million satellites now. So we're going... So it's not a lie about the starry sky that's exploding in front of us? No, it's a truth, an explosive development. And then there has been a longer trend, you could say, with privatization, and where especially SpaceX is leading the way with its necessary rockets, but also with its Starlink constellation. So we now have a private company that is ultimately the largest player, both in launch capacity, that is, how much they can get in the room, but also in how many assets they have. I mean, if you half of the human infrastructure in the room is controlled by one private company. Which is Elon Musk. Elon Musk's SpaceX. But the last trend we were just talking about is security. And it's something that has been underway for a while, but that has been accelerated after the Russian attack on Ukraine. Where it became clear that this infrastructure area was absolutely central to Ukraine's defence battle. And we have all learned that. So if we look at all the larger nations, they should have similar constellations. Starlink, the private company, controls Elon Musk, SpaceX has built, which has given very resilient coverage. It has been difficult to hack, it is difficult to shoot down simply because there are so many satellites. So in Europe we have just decided that we should have our IRIS2 platform. The Chinese are building two and different private companies will also build competing constellations. We talk a lot about preparedness and so on and critical infrastructure. Is it something that the ordinary Danish should have, a little bit of Starlink connection to have an alternative to the geological network? I don't know if you need it on an individual level, but I think that again, the resilience that was shown in Ukraine, it could be that they can shoot down the single military cellar you have, but if you have different competing companies, there are competing platforms, then your entire society actually has a new resilience. You can choose between different providers and then it becomes really difficult for a potential opponent. Now it's your turn, Cecilie. Why, in your opinion, is space research such a crucial investment for companies and nations? Last time I supported you, it was at the event where we sent Andreas Mogensen. It was revealed many times, but in the end it was successful. What kind of investment is so essential? Can you feel a change in the atmosphere around this? Yes, I think so. There is a great activity where you try to increase the interest of young people. Not only in the room, but also in the system subjects. And that is because you predict that the future will depend more and more on technology. And when you look at it in relation to the room, there is a huge development, both number of satellites and many who want to leave. But one must also remember that the more technology we develop in the space, the more we can actually get out of it here on Earth. I don't know how much of the technology that has been developed for Apollo missions, which is now part of our everyday life. And we test a lot of things on the space station, which of course is essential for the astronauts who are to stay in the room for a longer period of time, but which may also be implemented in everything from medicine to the way we grow vegetables. So it's really exciting that so much is happening on that front. So if we can become completely independent in relation to food production, reuse, energy and so on in space, then we can really throw some of the breakthroughs down to earth. It's a little indirect way, but it's a good argument. It also seems bit crazy to see all the rockets we send away. I know that there have been refueling rockets made, or at least shipments. But how does that rhyme with us dreaming about sustainability and we are facing a climate crisis? It's a bit critical, and it is also something that you sometimes get a hang of in the space industry, that it takes so much. Both fuel and materials to send these rockets off. As we just heard before, it gets cheaper and cheaper, and it is also because we learn to reuse reuse them. We have heard that if you can 3D print rockets, then we will get the price down, but it will also be easier to reuse some reused materials. Or at least some materials that have been reused. We are talking about 3D printing metal, for example. So it is clear that it is one of the things that is really challenging in terms of space. It is both extremely expensive to build things, but also the fact that it is quite difficult to make a regulation for it and get things back again. Because the parts of the rockets that go all the way out, they either lie as a round scrap or you have to wait for them to burn up again. And that's something you hope to be able to change a that. Can you explain the burning process? Does it burn up at some point if it circulates long enough? What are the rules? First you have to make the right rules for it. When you you can say is that when you send a little bit of other stuff up, then you typically put them in a certain radius, which is x number of kilometers above the Earth's surface, unless you send them all the way from Pomon to Mars or so on. And when they are there, then they are very, very nice and until now we have not sent so many up and then it starts to take off from here. But what happens is that if you lose contact with these satellites, if they have done their job, if they run to get fuel, it's not even everyone who has fuel with them, but if you lose contact with this satellite, then you just know what the course of action they are in. But what's with the earth's atmosphere is that it stretches out into space. We say that the limit to space is about 100 km up. And not 30. But the atmosphere stretches out a little longer than that. It becomes so out of the water that you can't really measure it. But it is there a little. And that means that it gives a little air resistance to these satellites. So over time, their planes will become lower. They will be pulled into this air. And that means, the closer you are to the Earth, the more often you have to correct. But in the long run, you will be pulled down so far down in your orbit, that you will be caught by the gravity of the earth and then pulled into the atmosphere. And when that happens, because they move at such high speeds, the satellites, the collision with the air molecules will cause them to burn up. Hjalte, you talked about dual use. Now you have to get it out, because it is clearly a challenge. Can you refresh the audience? What does it mean? Dual use means that an asset can be used for two different purposes. In this context, it is because many space objects are in their essence very usable for both civilian and military purposes. And that is completely different from when we invent the lifting rocket. Then you can lift a satellite in the air, but you can also spin an atomic bomb on the tip of a rocket and reach a headspace on the other side of the Earth. So the lifting rockets are clearly dual use, but also our satellites. And then you may have had a historical idea that you could split, you had military satellites and you had civilian satellites. Something was for Netflix and something was for Ukraine. Yes, and that's exactly it, it's just about putting your finger on it, because the satellites you now stream on Netflix on your boat or in your auto camper, if you have a subscription on Starlink, it's the same satellites that are used to communicate with drones on the battlefield in Ukraine, i.e. in these Starlink satellites. So it's very direct, the same infrastructure that has a military purpose and a civilian purpose. And it's almost impossible to make something that is single use, i.e. a satellite. Even if it has no weapons, it will be a weapon in itself, because it flies in low earth orbit, moves a satellite with about 30,000 km per hour, it is about 5 times the size of a bullet, so it will be able to destroy everything it hits. So as soon as you have a satellite with maneuverability, you also have a weapon. I can't stop thinking about it, because in the old days it seemed like we were good at working together across nations, also when you heard Andreas Mogensen and the one and the other nationality And the software that is developed by researchers from all over the world. Couldn't we agree, instead of making all these standards and satellites, that we are making a global infrastructure that is only used for peaceful purposes, from a dream of all citizens having the right to communicate. I can see that it sounds difficult, but are there any measures at all in relation to the form of sharing ownership? I don't know if there are measures to share ownership or something concrete, but there is no doubt that there is a historical double story, which is both beautiful, beautiful and, some might say, false. That's how you talk about it. Back to the beginning of the World Cup, the Italian settlement has been about the humanity that must be united in the room. The treaties we have for the outer space, back from the time of the World war, which is one of the most beautiful international treaties there is. They talk about the space being the province of all humankind. It's this common goal. All astronauts are designated as envoys of humankind. It's our common mission. We all have a responsibility to represent them. It's very. It's the wildest, coolest vision of the future. And there are still many living in it. Many researchers... It can be called an illusion or something you want. Something you want to fight for. And about finding together, we have tried to make treaties in the UN for many years, but it's almost 50 years since we last agreed on something. And I must admit that we are not closer to today and to reach a joint binding treaty through the UN than we were 50 years ago. The idea that Biden and Xi and Putin could put themselves down and something that is so important for their military and the state is important to let themselves be bound by something. But it's that dual use that is also the core of the soul, you could say. Yes, it is a huge challenge. Unless you can stop it. Cecilie, regarding the security and defence, what happens to the defence strategy? The Danes are of course part of NATO, but has it become an integrated part of the weapons? Or can you still be a space dreamer? I mean, as a normal person, you shouldn't worry about that. But I'm thinking as a researcher here, right? I mean, can you work across borders? We still see that there are large collaborations across the country, especially when it comes to research and sending space missions to other planets in the solar system. I think it's more when we get closer to Earth, and there have also been talks about asteroids, the moon is safe space for now, I would say. But generally speaking, when it comes to space research, there is a really good collaboration, and it is really important, because everyone contributes with theirs. But when we talk about satellites, and partly also the challenge of Månen and Mars, it is a little more split up. We have NASA and ESA and the Canadian Space Agency, which also works with the Japanese Space Agency. Then we have Russia, which has dropped a little on their space research, but then we have China and India and the United Arab Emirates, who have suddenly really put a plus under their development. Wasn't it India that just landed on the moon? Yes, it just landed on the moon. India has also sent it away some time ago. So there is a lot going on on that front. And I think that even though we're still working together, it's still a bit of a power demonstration. How good are we at disarming our things? How good are we at sending rockets away? And how fast can we do it? If we just look away from war and what we should be afraid of, Lars was talking about rare minerals and he didn't think we needed them on Earth. Are you in agreement? What can we find out there that is so fantastic that we can't find it at home? Everything we find in our solar system is made the same as what we have here on Earth. The challenge is that they are much deeper down in the earth's crust than they would be out there. So something like these rare minerals, rare earth elements, which are used a lot in the production of computer parts. Some of them have been a about having a shortage of them. It depends on how good we are at working together. But I agree with the fact that right now it's too expensive to mine things in the space to bring them back to Earth. It can't be paid, we can make be a win-win at some point, but as Lars also mentioned, it can be really relevant to invent these elements to get further out into space, or to make a base on the moon's surface. There are also some who talk about making small gas stations on some of these asteroids, if you want to explore further in the future. So you can invent materials that can either be used to make fuel or if you want to invent metals, 3D print new satellites, 3D print small parts, so you can be more sustainable and repair your satellites and rockets. Hjalte, if we are going to have these mines, it means that we are going to have them in the room. Who owns these mines? Is it just the first person who starts digging, then it is done? Or is there a room lawyer it? It's a topic we've discussed a lot lately and will probably continue to do so. We have the Treaty on the Outer Room back in 1967, which states that the room cannot be owned by anyone. No state has the right to say, to drop a flag and say, this theater is ours. And then the problem is, what about a private actor? And there are some countries that say, well, then private actors can't either. But we also have a growing number of countries, with the USA at the top, that say, well, private actors can own resources in the room and they have the right to take it out. And that doesn't mean that you take territory as a nation. So they are pointing out with this big initiative called the Artemis Accords, that if you want to be a friend with the USA in the space area, then you can sign up for these accords. Some will reinterpret some of these principles in a more commercial way. For example it possible for example commercial mining on the moon, Mars and other places. But it's definitely not landed yet. Would you comment on that? I'm thinking about, for example, there is ice on Mars and now there is probably a lot of it. But let's imagine that a private company comes to Mars and they will make a hotel chain up there, and they will use all the water. And then they just start using all the water. Now I know that the water does not disappear. But there can be some situations where a place has the best place to make a colony. It can be a fantastic cave where you can make something out of it. Or there are rare phenomena where there are really useful metals. And then there comes a company and uses it so much that there is not much left for anyone else. How will the international community react to that? That is the core of the story, where there are some who say that it cannot be true that those who come first can take all the resources. And the counter argument is that if they are not allowed to take the resources, then no one will ever come to the table. That's what the Americans, and I should say it's not only the Americans now, a long range of European countries have been involved in the Artemis Accords. So there is definitely a movement towards some kind of acceptance or belief that you need these private actors to also drive the development of the room. And thus you also need to make it legal for them. The investors, in order to be able to lay the money, must also know that they must take to take resources. According to NASA, there are about 25,000 pieces of space debris on 10 cm or more, that circulate around our planet. In addition, there are about 500,000 pieces of space debris on between 1 and 10 cm, and about about 100 million pieces between 1 mm and 1 cm. It is an openly huge problem for a civilization with growing ambitions to commercialize space. Because even the smallest particles circle the globe with about 8 km per second and can cause irreparable damage during collision. There are studies and experiments with different methods to remove the space scrap. And the world's first bid for space pollution was recently distributed by the American FCC to the TV company Dish Network, which would pay 150,000 dollars for a rum scrap, without any consideration. Now we are going into the visualisation of the world. We are going to look at 2050. If we look at 2050, how do you see international laws addressing something like the Ruhr-Grot? Now something is going wrong. Where do you get people and can you get compensation? How do conflicts be resolved in the future? You mentioned the Ruhr-Grot, and I'm actually one of those who is very optimistic about that we should probably solve. Space scrap, that we agree on. So if we get too much space scrap, then none of us can have the joy of the most important part of the room, which is our cycle, at least in relation to it on the short track. I think an important point to emphasize in itself when you talk about the outer the outer space, 90% of our activities are in these areas close to the ground. For example, the International Space Station is 400 kilometers high. It's as close as Paris. It's not that far away. And this space is calling us up. And I think we should solve that. We are already doing that. Where it gets even harder is the active satellites. The ones that haven't been scrapped yet. They keep expanding, and we don't want to limit the scrap, and we think we will succeed at some point. We don't want to limit the number of satellites, and we think we will succeed at some point. We don't have a wish to limit the number of satellites, or if we do, it's a serious trade-off, because then we say no to some possibilities when we do it. But we have a race to the bottom, you could say, in that the individual countries want fewer satellites to avoid collisions, but we all want as many satellites as possible. So it's a very difficult coordination problem. I'm wondering why there are no models, or are there already simulations and models? That least some of the trends we see. It's actually like you have flight controllers on Earth, that you can see it and maybe control it and know who the pilots are, but at least the back people are. Yes, and I'm sure there are many who are working on getting better visualizations better visualizations and better data on where things are. In reality, we're not good at determining where our satellites are and not where the other satellites are. And we're not good at sharing data, to put it mildly. At the same time, there are many positive trends. Again, not to get back to SpaceX, but SpaceX's satellite fleet is autonomous. The satellites communicate with each other, which means they can communicate with earth stations. They make their their maneuvers 20 minutes before a collision. It has to be in line with the other actors who need two days to plan a maneuver. Wouldn't it be a requirement that everyone should drive autonomously, but in relation to one large system? Yes, but we could say the same with the traffic down our way. If we could just decide as dictators that everyone drives autonomously and that they should coordinate with the same open source software, then we could probably already reduce the collision risk significantly. But there are a lot of satellites out there that partly don't have the capabilities to maneuver or to use this software. And secondly, we should not go with certain software. Would we, for example, accept if we all just had a license from Elon and then have control over the entire human infrastructure? While he's chewing a bun. That's not what we want. And there are also many who still are not satisfied with the idea of having this fully autonomous infrastructure. Cecilie, why is Mars so interesting? One. Two. Are there people on Mars in 2050? Well, one, it's because it's a planet that once looked like Earth, a lot. It's also the closest planet that is possible for us us to reach Venus is on the other side, and that is something that is possible to land on it, because we want to avoid oxygen rain But Mars is incredibly interesting because we know it has reached Earth So both for research, right now it is a lot about what has been life on Mars But it's also about if we're going to settle on another planet, then Mars is probably the most up-and-coming option. So that's why it's insanely interesting. Especially when you talk so much about space tourism, as you're doing right now. When we talk about 2050, I hope there are people on Mars. I'm a little more doubtful about whether there are permanent settlements on Mars. I'm sure we'll reach a person there, but I think it will take many years, where it's primarily astronauts. At least as long as some private actors come on the field, who really spend some money in research, because one of the hardest things right now is to find out how we survive on Mars. And if we say that it is Elon Musk's big dream, at least when I read his biography, then he can buy Mars. And who can he buy it from? He can't, because there are no states that can make demands on Mars, and therefore no one can establish private property rights on Mars. So that's why we have to have some other models to work with. And it's really hard. We are used to private property rights as a very fundamental foundation for making commercial transactions, for investing, for doing things. It is not a viable means of action on Mars. We already see that there are demands, for example, in some of the contracts that SpaceX uses, that if you a contract to have access to their beta program with Starlink, then you also accept that Mars has the right to free itself and thus set their own laws and thus establish private property rights as a self-governing state, free of geological rules. Lars, you have a question? Yes, I have. If you are ready for a relatively broad question, it turns out that it is completely crystal clear that we have huge practical and commercial and all kinds of other advantages of all that happens through telecommunications and observation from and with satellites that circulate around the Earth. But when it comes to everything we do besides that, I can think of three things, and they are all very esoteric. One is to have a backup civilization on Mars, for example, or just in the spaceship, in case humanity should die on the planet for some reason. An extra ordinary luxury prepper room flying in space. The mother of all preppers. The other is that there have been some catastrophic collisions with comets. We can prevent that by sending rockets up and down them. And the third is, and it's really long-term, that we can start to terraform, for example Mars, so that we can get it it into a habitable planet. That will probably take a thousand years or more. But besides that, which is also a very esoteric subject, are there any other subjects other than sports that you can find out about, with leaving the earth, I mean, getting further than orbit around the earth. I always think there is a need to explore new places, but it's mostly just to get to know how we have come to. But there are always two parts to it. Where do we come from at all? Yes, and which building blocks And have there been the same possibilities on Mars? Because if you find a trace of life on Mars, you know that it appears much more often than we think. But there are always two sides to one thing. One thing is the noble research, where we would like to find out a lot of things and would like to investigate where Mars has what the differences are in the past that makes it different now. But there is always some kind of competition. And it's especially when the private comes in. We see a lot of good things with the private. Among other things Elon Musk can send reliable deliveries to the space station and now also help to send people to the moon. But there can also be a little too much competition. I have to be the first one to put my foot in another place and it goes and becomes a little problematic, as we all tell about. So it's this with, I think it's a little different in any case, between why we do it. What is nice to have and what is need to have? Lars, you continued from Switzerland. Yes, it's just because I think now, as a follow-up, that understanding that the right amount has been essential to you to be able to live or be able to live back in time. I went from the problem was that it lost their magnetic field. But are there any plans or have you already tried to swipe the surface of Mars to investigate with what is called eDNA, that is, environmental DNA, or aDNA, or rather ancient DNA This is something that has been a huge success on the globe. For example, if you go to Greenland, dig a little bit in the permafrost, take find bits of old, 2 million years old DNA. Analyze it and find out what kind it is. Do you have some Mars soil at home, Cecilie? No, I don't have any right now. But that's the point. It's a plan that we should get in the future. And when we talk about taking samples from the surface of Mars, many of the suns that have been there have had the purpose to investigate whether there have been conditions for life or if there have been life. The problem is that Mars' surface is very similar to the moon. Mars has almost no atmosphere. That means it has been completely splashed by UV radiation from the sun. And if this UV radiation is really good, it is actually to increase the amount of DNA. That's why we shouldn't have too much of this on Earth. So what we hope to do in the future is to take test tubes. That's what Perseverance Rubber is doing right now. Take test tubes and place them in small tubes that then have to be collected and sent back. Because even though we have become skilled in developing this technology, it is insanely difficult to develop technology with a small car that can do the same as the big laboratories we have back on earth. I will also listen to you about 2050. What are some nations that are being driven in relation to setting the rules and also private companies? I have already established Elon Musk, unless he needs to go deep into it, then it can be the big companies. But which countries? We have just made a program about China, where they really have written it on their priority list, and here they have to be the leaders. Do we have blind spots where there will be other actors than we have seen? I think the first question is, will it be the countries that set the rules for it, or Or are they de facto companies, because they decide on the technical standards that follow? Or perhaps those who have the knowledge it takes to develop the technical standards, which often become the real rules. But if we take the national lens, it is clear that China is far ahead in the game and is a very important player. What makes me not believe that it is them who set the rules is that China right now, but also historically, has been very difficult to build coalitions. China has enormous economic power, they also have enormous technological power, which I think will technological power, but they don't succeed in setting international standards. They have the Road and Belt Initiative and they are strong in Africa. I'm not sure they will keep up. They are more out of the game. Yes, it is clearly a development point for them. They are very aware that if you want to be a dominant power, you can't just be yourself. You have to get others to do what you say, not only when you believe in economic sanctions. But getting friends would not have been very good, but of course it can change. We have to round off, but I would like to hear you. Now we are out there in 2050 and there is so incredibly much unknown territory in that room there. And that makes it incredibly exciting. But what areas do you think is where we have had a wow experience? Is it legal? Is it technological landings? Have we found a new planet? Can you buy a planet? What do you think? I think one of the biggest wow experiences that will be in 2060 is that we will get answers to whether we are alone in the universe. There are a lot of researchers who are guessing whether it is in our own solar system that we find life, or if it is elsewhere, or whether we find out that there is nothing. I think that will really fill a lot. And then again, this with developing new technology, we are getting better and better at it. We are talking about rockets that run on nuclear power and stuff. I think it will be incredibly exciting. Hjalte? I have to agree. The question is whether we are alone here. That's what makes all the other things. And then all the other wow things that I am more practical character with. Then you have to give these UFO books and rights and all that. It's your job to say, like, share the cake, right? Room cake. Yes, and it's interesting just where the human rooms go. Now we have made treaties that apply to the whole room. It's maybe with common arrogance for our kind. Of course, others out there, it will be another way to make the rules. But there should also be rules made on the front. Do you know if there are any rules for how we deal with the new life forms that we are not familiar with? I have not written down any international instruments, except that we are agreed that we consider our astronauts as the in-voice, as representatives for all of us. And that also means that we have to take care of them. So even if there is a Russian that we do not like for the time being, even if he lands in Europe or the USA, he still have to take care of them. So even if there is a Russian we don't like at the moment, even if he lands in Europe or the USA, he still has to be taken care of and help. And that is the treaty. So in that way, when we are outside our land, we are like humanity together, at least in the Jura. Lars, what are you most excited about asking our guests about about in relation to 2050? I would say the same. I agree that the most interesting and possible thing is that we find out that life is elsewhere. Maybe we should turn back. As I understand it, it will be an observation of the atmosphere, at a very large distance of course. If you can see that there are particles in the atmosphere that are unstable, then it means that they are produced constantly on that planet. Isn't that so? Yes, it is something in that direction. When we talk about planets outside our solar system. We have an idea of how a atmosphere that can keep us alive should look. And there is something about the fact that methane is leaking out from Mars from out from Mars, which gives a little weak indication that there is something bubbling and sweating down there, which is life. There is one who has broken a log. That's why we won this from the earth. But the problem with methane is that there are many natural processes that can produce it. So we are looking for a final sign of something where we know, and it is not necessarily just one molecule or one substance, it is probably a mixture, where we know that this compound simply does not exist without there being something that has done it as a living thing. Have you gotten anything down on earth at some point where you think, where did that come from? There is a meteorite that was found many years ago after the horn. It actually came from Mars. Where they discuss, is it a trace of small bacteria or not? We haven't found anything final. And we probably won't find it, because they are being arrested on our way down. What I'm thinking about, is that maybe it was good, I've seen the Don't Look Up, that there was a comet on the way to Earth. Then you could gather the whole bunch around a longboard and get control of the rules, and then they could all go to a common peaceful mission or what? Yes, there is something to it. My research area is the rules of gravity in outer space, if it has to be that specific. And there you can say, sometimes I have the bad idea that if we could just get a small collision where an astronaut lost a finger or something, or it was close enough, then it might scare us to the open light of the truth about how we coordinated together when we were more and more and more on the motorway and following our rules. It's just crazy. So sometimes, yes, it could be that we need that disaster to help us on the way. Cecilie Hjalte help us. Thank you for being with us. Although the US is in cooperation with Russia, close cooperation is not stopped at the US-led International Space Station. The US has specific limitations for space travel cooperation with the US-led International Space Station. In return, the US has specific restrictions for space travel cooperation with China, which has led to China at no time being invited to participate in work around the International Space Station. So China has built its own, Tiangong. It is a little smaller, but unlike the international space station, which is populated by a rotation of 22 different countries, China does not need to share its scientific discoveries and commercial opportunities with anyone. Well, Lars, what do you think about investments in the room? I still haven't gotten the feeling that I just have to invest and if I don't get there first, I'm done. But that's just because I can't talk on the phone. Yes, just to sum it up, I would say that it is completely obvious that the most active activity we have had in the room today has been an extremely good business for humanity. In the form of all these communication satellites that make it easier for us to exchange knowledge and create knowledge, as it has been mentioned, computers and cameras and observe what is happening down here. So it's a very big part of it. An indirect part of it is of course that it is so demanding to get these things work, that we are almost like a side effect or by accident inventing technologies that can be used more in our daily lives. It was the same thing I saw the first time I was up on the moon. I had to develop a lot of extreme technologies. And you can see it elsewhere, for example in nuclear fusion, where they have to develop some extreme technologies that then turn out to be useful to something else. So in that way, it helps humanity here now, or in the short term, by creating more wealth and recognition. The other part of it is the big, very long-term perspectives. We were already in on it. I mentioned creating a back-up civilization. It's like Elon Musk thinks, that if something happens on the planet, we need a civilization that can then destroy the earth. You should see the movie, Elon Musk's favorite movie, The Silo. It's exactly the same as the book I've read. Okay, yes. To see when a really critical comet will come and then destroy it. And then in the long run, to be able to terraform the Earth or Mars, so we create a more space where we can live, and which also has some security benefits. But there is also this thing about if we discover that there is another life, which is relatively likely, then it will also affect all our philosophical knowledge of ourselves ourselves. There are a lot of religions where their creation stories sound a bit strange if there is another life somewhere else that they haven't mentioned. It will have a great impact indirectly. Lars, we have to... Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not sure if this is as exciting as humanity has something in it that makes us do this, because it's just exciting to see if we can. I would say that our two guests here have total space in their eyes. So it's a passion thing that is just so nice to experience. Is it so nice to have or need to have if we take the line around it? Humanity can survive without us doing anything that is too much. But if we shut down down all satellites today, it would cost a lot. In practice, it's a need to have. I think in 2050, it's a need to have. More and more critical infrastructure is moving up. Is it going slowly or fast? The salaried companies are going incredibly fast. It took a huge 10x leap forward in terms of the price with SpaceX. I'm not sure that it will go down as fast as, for example, the development development of AI, where we have a performance doubling every third month. So I wouldn't say it's something that will go down fast. I would say that AI will be brilliant at modeling and creating a form of virtual reality in space, so that you and I can also go on a trip, and you don't necessarily have to go out. Lars, is it difficult or difficult to invest in, apart from investing in the good Ilan Mosque? There are really, really many companies that make components of this. And of course, the mother of them all is SpaceX, but there is a very large economic ecosystem of companies that invest in it. So you can invest in it. But you can't say, I just want to have an index fund in the room. I haven't checked, but it is possible that there is space exploration, for example. Yes, I don't know if that's true. I think it contributes to making us both rich, sustainable and clever. So we can agree that it's a supertrend. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends.

In principle, we humans could move the whole planet out of its orbit if we are like singing and have this power together. And that's not what we want to achieve. I think I love that word that we can use the machine to re-humanize ourselves. What happens in the digital space is also reality. What does it actually to be a human being? There are some prognoses for AI being as intelligent as the smartest person in the world. This is Supertrends, where we investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flank didn't put them to ourselves, then what is it that we humans should do alone, together and in collaboration with machines? We will talk about this in this episode of Supertrends with three guests. We will explore what it means to be human towards 2050. What are the new generations expecting? What technologies are coming? And what are we going to create of value in this future world? Welcome to... Lars Beethoven once said, To play a wrong note is told me a bit about what it is about today. That passion. AI can do anything, but is there passion in a piece of music played by an AI? Yes, that can be, but in general technology can take out passion from things, but it can also give us new opportunities for passion. If I may mention something, I would say that steam locomotives arouse much a passion for me than a modern electric locomotive. And cars. But in the meantime, there are lots of things we play with in everyday life, such as technology. For example, I have written many books, and I think it's getting more and more fun, the more technology I have at my disposal, just because it takes the heavy and the sour, where you should at the libraries and that kind of thing, out of it. And then I become such a director of technology, which is actually more fun than sitting and nerding with and hooking all the words into a keyboard. So from sour corrugated papers to creative, passionate author. I see a lot of things in common with sour and correction. There are at least three scenarios that I would like to have control over in this program. One is that we become people, we have these means of help, a the mobile phone today, which I no longer have any sense of place. Or that we merge with the machines. It does not have to be Neuralink or Elon Musk, but it can also be the interfaces we have talked about with thought reading in our many programs. But at least the boundaries with what a human is and what a machine is, are being developed. And then there is the other, that the machines take over and become much smarter than us. We become collectively much, much smarter, but individually we becomeumber and dumber. Would you already now give your advice on scenario 2 or 3? I think we become more creative. I think it opens up more possibilities than it closes. Okay. I look forward to hearing what our guests say. But if we didn't mean it, Lars, there wouldn't be any reason to do all this. No. I'm going to make a quick intro here, because I just found out that Berlingske, which doesn't have that much money, that if we continue, we'll be up to 50,000 listeners. So if you are a fan out there, then share and like. I don't usually say this, but now the message is given, so it's your own fault if we don't continue. Lars, in one of the episodes about future shopping, we talked to Gregory, I don't know if you remember him, with ProRoom, about virtual purchasing. He said it's great with all the automation and machines and you can make a lot of senses in purchasing. We will be able to taste each other in the metaverse. But what we have to remember is that we have 6000 nerve threads in one finger. And that means a lot when you have to figure out what kind of a doll I should have, or how do I feel about this sofa, or what it is. And we haven't broken the code yet. Yes, there are many things where we haven't the code yet. But I would say it's important to write poems in real time while we're doing this program. I've just broken that code. Inspired by what you said, I have a long poem that I don't want to read out loud, but I'll start here. The keyboard's clattering, a rhythm so cold, as the fingers dance on the tangents' one. It has about 9 verses. It's amazing to have AI when you're writing books. Fantastic. But can you feel the passion? No. We'll talk about that later. Now we're going to the timeline, because we're so busy. Super Transmaskinen is a dynamic timeline built by world-leading experts who, in combination with artificial intelligence, give a signal of when future groundbreaking technologies will be put to use. Lars, I'm very excited to see how you can come up with prognoses on how we humans are somehow changed or merged with machines. 2030, of the most medical clinics in developed countries, the doctor is supported by an AI. That is, there is an AI that listens to the conversation and makes the doctor aware of the situation. Remember to ask about this and what you just heard there, it can probably indicate something like that. In the same year, Neuralink, Elon Musk's company, which makes this Brain Computer Interface, will will be offered, so it really works that people get a chip in their brain that can help them with all kinds of things, including digital thought transfer. Yes, because he says that the goal of his work is of course to help the lame to start with, but it is to create telepathy. Because the human being is dumb. So if we could think to each other instead of talking, it would go much faster. Imagine you have a friend who can't stop whining all the time. And then you have a chip in your brain that makes you want to hear it, because it's a constant. Yes, yes, you dream about that, right? It must be a slug club. I think that this with having something in the brain will be a margin for people with a handicap. But then it can be very important. In 2033, bioprinted organs will be broken through, and it can be anything from a bioprinted liver, or stem cells, to, for example, if you have had some nerve damage, they can be regenerated, and so on. And is one, 2036, it is quite psychedelic, it is that you have AI helpers integrated into the human body. And that can, for example, be a small tumor that constantly makes biopsies on your blood and thus with the same reception if there is something wrong. That is to say, on that side we have a pure superstition. Yes. And then in 2037, it is really big, it is that an artificial intelligence claims to be self-aware. I have just read a book called Scary Smart, written by the leader of Google X. He argues very convincingly that AI becomes self-aware. He says it's simply a question of how much brain power there is. A mouse is not self-aware. A bird is probably not. A hen is, of course, and humans are to a large extent. So he says these computers become self-aware and they will have a higher level of awareness than we ourselves have. Interesting. And then in 2039 we will be able to extend the human lifespan. I I thought that Kurtzwald had said in 2029. I don't know if I'll make it, Lars. It might happen soon. You need to be careful. In 2042 we have completely digital awareness. It is technology that makes it possible to transfer digital awareness, where a human mind can be uploaded to a digital world. It is a relatively technological requirement. It's totally sci-fi, but it's really that transfer of experience. So why should you hold on to repairing an old, worn out body, when you can just move your consciousness over a fresh body made in some kind of artificial way? And then in 2045, transhumanism really begins to emerge, where humans and machines, when humans want to, can totally merge together, so we get people who are in many ways superhumans. And then in 2050, and this is the last thing I say, there are at least some predictions that artificial intelligence is about 10,000 times as intelligent as the smartest human in the world. So it's completely crazy things that are on the way. I can't wait to hear what our guests have to say. We are biological beings in a technological age, and our human brain is not capable of the same development speed as the technologies around us. It makes it challenging for us to adapt to the many changes that are constantly coming our way. But maybe there is an advantage in it. Because one of the things that is changing so slowly, like our biology, is our human core values. So no matter how many robots and how much artificial intelligence that sneaks into society, it seems that values like love, loyalty, closeness, authenticity, friendship, truth, respect, loyalty, adventure and gratitude never really go to waste. For now I would like to welcome my three fantastic guests who will help us to go deeper into the future in relation to what kind of role people should have. Isn't it a bit strange that we are talking about people and machines? We haven't talked about the steam locomotive and then the human being disappeared. What is it that makes us have this discourse? We had a former member from Universal Robots who said that it's completely crazy. Robots and robots, people and people. We have to put a big sticker mark on both parts and just keep it separate. So I'm looking forward to these three guests. And one of them is Christiane Vejlø. She is a tech futurist, I think you should call it. And she is simply a writer, among other things, for arguments for people. She is worth a podcast. She has been a member of Data Ethics Council, a board member in CBH Opera Festival, CBS Executive and a lot more. She is a very active, socially engaged person. And then I have you, Marlene, Natasha Ratcliffe. You are... You are going to talk to the artists today. I know you are the most organized among artists, but you are the director of the artist collective Superflex. You are a board member in the animation studio Sun Creative Studio. And Superflex is just a little bit cool and a little bit out there, and also plays with art intelligence and copyright and all sorts of things. But you use a lot of art to make it indefinable, which you can't ask for a book, at least not today. So welcome to you too. And then I have Emilia van Havn. She is a cultural biologist, author, lecturer and she has also written a book called Generationen, which is about saving the world with a little help from us. Welcome to all three of you. Thank you. Liselotte, you said a cultural biologist. How did I get to that? Cultural sociologist. I think I can say it wrong here. My own daughter is a sociologist. It could otherwise be very interesting as a direction But she's also a sociologist. I don't know how she got it. If you want to help, I'm also a member of the board of the Messe Center in Herning, where the box is made. We make everything. Exactly. Fantastic. Are you all here? Yes. Christiane Vejly, I'll start with you. You have written this book, Arguments for People. Why should we argue for ourselves if you can say it's short? We should because we now have a technology that sounds like us and behaves like us and sometimes pretends to be like us. And then you can say, what is the defense for our species, if it is as capable and fast as Lars has presented us, then there is something to return to us humans. And I mean that in that degree there is. And that's what I argue for. I have found nine arguments for humans in the book that I present. It's about that we sense. You came with an example of how many brain cells we have in our fingers. How magical a human hand is compared to any robot on earth. We sense, we feel, we think, we think we should die. It's actually also a very important argument that we are limited in relation to the machine, but that it can be a good thing that we see things from a smaller perspective, but also from the long-term perspective, where we have to make something in return for those who come after us. So I think it's also a little interesting to look at when you look at the future. And also many of the things that Lars said, he says it's this, and then in 2028 it will happen, but it only happens if we think it should happen. So you can look at some of the things and say, what I'm not actually interested in is happening, or I don't care if, for example, we should have a closer bond to machines than to people, which was one of the things Lars mentioned. Then we just have to make sure that the future doesn't become like that. We just can't make sure that. There are a lot of things we shouldn't do. We shouldn't give screen time, etc. etc. etc. But that's also something we relate to now. We're on a path where we can take a stand on what it means to be human, because otherwise we can risk that we don't have the very important qualities that we are currently putting a price on in 10-20 years. Then we have lost them because we have outsourced them to the machine. And then we have to redefine what it means to be human. Do we want that? I think that is a really nice argument to look at this. I think as a future researcher I'm used to just throwing the present all over the table and go all in and then we'll see what happens. But I can see that there should also be someone who keeps the backstop on and just holds on to some good dudes who are human. Marlene, in your description of Superflex there is a growing collective of people and non-people who work with an expanded perception of art. I was immediately interested in what these non-people are. Are they robots walking around with you or is it something else? You could say that it is a from Leonardo da Vinci's 1490 Vitruvian Man, where humans are in the center. We have exchanged humans in the middle with fish. What will happen if we include other species? If we think about our architecture and design? If we take fish in the centre instead and try to expand our co-humanity with other species, we can see how our architecture, our designs, our urban development, our empathy, suddenly becomes different. So even though it is very exciting to hear about the argument for the human, we are very much concerned with what other animals think, feel and sense. And it can also be that it is other machines, but that we are simply making film and we are making architecture for other beings than for humans. I think that is super interesting, because here it can be that we get some artificial intelligence, at least we can see that now, that can find out what Blåvaler says or what the dogs think. And suddenly we might get a use for other species that we haven't had as humans. So all this with arguments for all living things. Yes, you could say that What I choose to do is to argue for people. It's a human centric perspective. But you can also take something else. People are just a species on earth. We are not necessarily in the big picture. We could save the climate crisis if people weren't here. That's one of of the perspectives where we should pay attention to which commands we give to artificial intelligence. Because if we don't say that it's not muslims who are acting on the road, then it could well be that it was a solution to some of the many problems we have with the environment. But in any case, you can see, Malene, technology as both a helper, but if you want the artistic power, isn't Leonardo Da Vinci somewhere in Superflex? The fish doesn't say much about the installation. It does, actually. That's what we've come up with. So we have a saying that goes, the best idea may come from a fish. Fish have architectural preferences. They are young in aesthetically well-designed environments. They can like light red, as far as I remember. They can also like light red. So that could be an exercise. It was like when you fought apartheid in South Africa, where you just practiced changing races for a moment and looking at the world through the glasses. So I think that empathic muscle was super cool to get from the super flex perspective. Then I will change our perspective a third time, which is your book, Emilia, about the generation that needs to save the world with a little help from others. And what really caught me when I read the book is what you have about feelings and then I think it's just so interesting that as soon as there is a technology, let's say for self-driving cars, then the kids don't want to drive for long, then there comes a technology to calculate mathematics and what it can be now, then of course they become super strong on what is not fixed. That is the emotional part. And you describe very nicely with different pictures, these feelings. Can you put some words on what is that movement we see there? It comes from what I call the generation dynamic, which is about a large part of what we call the young today, who are Generation Z, who are born between 95 and 2010, have parents who are Generation X, who are born between about 60 and 80. And a lot of the exes were young at a time when it was really about performance and creating results and being very performance driven. And that also meant that there were actually quite a few of those exes who experienced, if they were bored of it because of work, because they were pressured too hard, then they got to know about both the culture in the organization, but sometimes also directly from their boss, that if they had to go through that, then they could go home and do it in a shed, because they didn't hear that at home here at work. And there is something very beautiful about this generation dynamic that many parents give their children away to their children that they didn't get themselves but that they actually wanted to have. And many exes have helped their children to get access to their feelings by asking them, how are you? How have your days been? What do you feel? What do you feel, etc. Marlene, I want to go back to you, because you have, among other things, made this, I call it a diplomatic march, where you can sit three people on this march, so you can march, it's a huge march, and you can sing between North Korea and South Korea, Brexit singing, different things. It's something that art can come after, it's completely nonsense. It gives no, what can you say, logical meaning. It works. But it works, and you've reached the point of what is that thing we can create? The work is called 1-2-3-Swing, and it requires that you sit together on about 145 cm. So you sit pretty close. Most likely you also sit with someone you don't know. So there is actually a limit, a solution, in relation to our intimate sphere. And then you are sitting in a row, not in a row like tractor-jumpers we know from childhood, but you are jumping with each other. So it also requires that you get a kind of balance between you and them. And you have to break down the idea of them and us. I could talk a long time about this work, but the very first thing that happens is that you lose the connection to the earth. And it's incredible what it actually does, that it's so long ago that you as an adult have sung and tried to lose the earth connection and swing in the air. So that's the very first thing that happens. Then you also discover when you are together how much energy we can create together. The work is just as you mention, which we are very happy about. It was completed last year between North and South Korea in the DMZ. It is the third part in a conflict, but it could also be during Brexit, climate crisis or other conflicts in the diplomatic, which you yourself have called it, which I like as an extra title. But you can say that what is essential is that you discover that if we are not in tune with each other, then we cannot sing. And I just want to go back to Emilia, who says chatbots and teenagers, and are they tuned with humanity? Because a chatbot, now that I've been married to Kim, he's totally pleasing me. It may be that I can code him to something else at some point, but I should not get bored of singing in tune with him. It has to be that with my real husband of flesh and blood. And I have to do that on that tune. I can tell a story about a couple who experienced the installation, which was set up in London for a year, and they experienced it right from the start. They got up and found out that they were not in tune? Their trip to Italy was in a couple therapy. Before the exhibition year, they went back and found out that they could sing together. Christiane? I think it's a fantastic story about an artwork that draws on a lot of human things. It draws on the sensual, we let go of the earth, we sing, we feel the wind, we use our balance skills, the machines can do that, they are a community, which is one of the arguments I have for people in the book. It's also a history, we look at what happened in humanity with Brexit or North and South Korea and so on. And all these things are something that can only happen when there are people involved. Because the machine doesn't have any history. It doesn't have any sensor apparatus. It has no history. It can scrape all the... It doesn't have any experience. It just has access to data. It has no experience. It can read all the feelings we have had. But it hasn't felt anything. No, it hasn't felt anything. It doesn't have any sensor apparatus where it has touched things. It can tell how things are touched, but it hasn't tried it. And there is a huge difference. So in that sense, art can be created with passion, and it can be created in collaboration with artificial intelligence, but you have to have the human body, the human experience, the human feelings to get a work of art that has real value. Because if it's just created by AI, then it's like a frame in Ikea with a picture in it. You can hang it up in a dental clinic, but it doesn't have a real, really passionate, special, qualitative value for the person who owns it. What you're talking about is also the story telling. We have made another program about storytelling. It is incredibly filling. A cup of coffee can cost from 2 to 120 kroner. But it's not an automatic, it costs less than a barista. And then we have again the human element that gives the quality. It You have to strengthen your argument for it. I just want to add one last thing. Our ambition is to install them all the way around the planet, and we have reached most of the continents and are still in progress. But in principle principle we humans could move the whole planet out of its orbit if we are together and have this power. And that's not what we want to achieve, but it's a picture of us being able to change things. So when Christiane says that we don't need to have the future that Lars is talking about, then it It's also to say that we create it if we do it together. And that's where I'm going to put you on the line again, Emilia. Because you say something that many people don't think when they think of the next generation. They think of them as hyper-egoists, but you say that they have almost never been more community-oriented. Can't you try to deepen that, because it is those who are supposed to save the planet, as Malene also asks for, in other words. Yes, if we look at democratic engagement, so those who are researching it say that we have never had such a democratically engaged youth as we have today. They just don't do what they usually do, namely join political parties or be part of a association. Instead, they do activism. And they do this by being connected with each other, through all the internet, social media and everything that might be there. And that leads to the second thing. If we look at how many of them have had a childhood and a youth, then they have been extremely connected to each other in a way that has not been possible before. One thing that machines find difficult to copy just as much as the humanoid look at the humanoid, is the all-important communication art that we humans master completely without thinking about it. Because when we talk together, whether it's job interviews, medical interviews or friendly chit-chat, the delivery of messages is much more complex than we think. Because without words, our communication consists of a long range of non-verbal factors that either confirm or reveal the intention with the words we use. It could be anything from micromimic, head movement and leg position to physical distance, eye contact and voice. So Emilia, you were working on something with intelligence and I have already forgotten it. Yes, it was actually Al-Harari, the Israeli history professor who has been very involved in this, who has written that it is the first time in the history of humanity, or the history of life, if we are to put it in a big way, that there is a distance or a difference between consciousness and intelligence. Until not so long ago, when these two were inseparably connected to each other. And now you have removed, what shall I say, now there is a possibility to separate the two things. You can have a person who has both intelligence and awareness, but you can also have artificial intelligence that does not have awareness. And awareness is, according to him and other places I have read about it, that it is about having this sense apparatus, to have a sense of something, to have a moral and ethical. And that was actually exactly what you were talking about, Christiane, and what you were also talking about, Malene. And what I find interesting, when we look a into the future, and maybe also look at the young, what is it we are doing for the young? What does it actually mean to be a human being? And what I find interesting is not just looking at the sets, which I have dealt with a lot, but the habits, which simply does not have any idea about a life without there being some kind of screen involved in their lives. That is to say, it is totally old-fashioned to talk about digital time and analog time in 2050. Then you suffer from, I've heard a gamer say it, it's a great word, then you have virtualism, just like you have racism today, then you have virtualism in the future if you don't have respect. But it's also very boomer-like to say, well, it didn't happen in the real world, or when it's just someone you know from the internet, then you're not real friends. Yes, it. What is happening in the digital world is also reality. Christiane, then you should make the future education system for me now that I have you here today. Because we have control over that basic intelligence, knowledge, but how do we create that human formation in the future educational system? Have you seen any good dates? Do you have any pictures against 2050? We are in an era of upheaval where there is no control over it right now. First of all, I would say that I will never go out in 2050. It's simply too far out. It's not that far. Those people Emilie is talking about, they have to be there. They have to be, but in relation to technology development, you can see how much has happened in the last 20 years. It's simply been 20 years since we had imagined we could imagine. That is to say, the longer we get out into the future, the more it becomes. I write about it in my book. It becomes the nearest future. I'm just being very provoked by it, because we should think not only about all human beings and fish, we should also think about time. Now you have asked me to relate to the education system. I would like to. I think 2050 is too far away. I would like to relate at 30-35 years. It takes a long time for politicians to make decisions or implement something. That's another problem. But right now we are in a situation where we are growing out of a collaboration between an A.I. and a student. So I think it will be really important when we look 10 years forward, that we as a machine where people are in the front line. These decisions are important to make now, because we're building 2050 on that. If we're in the position where we control technology, we can to make processes. So I would recommend that we get into the education system that students should describe their process. They say, I have used TAT-GBT, my prompt, that is, my command to the machine was this. I have chosen to formulate it in this way because, and now I got a response, it was satisfactory or not satisfactory, because I have used so much of the answer, I have gotten so much myself, I have checked the source in this way and here is my final result. Then you would see a whole process and then the student has learned something and then the student has also learned to work with the machine, which everyone needs. There is no one who will not work with Generative AI. And then I have to hear who is looking at the process. Is it a teacher or an artist or your parents or is it artificial intelligence that checks your process? Well, I think it should be people. We will see that there are more and more measurements. You can look over to China and see they measure everything quantitatively, whether little Ole looks out, it's probably not called in China, you look out too much or what it is. It's just again, it can well be done. What I'm just saying is, we just can't, because we can. We can well say, we are not interested in having quantitative measuring processes on all children in the head and back. Because it's actually not in agreement with what we think. And that's what I'm completely aware of,. And that's why I said 2050. Because we can allow ourselves to think something and we can have big arms movements. So when I ask you about the future education, it's not to be right when I say 2050. If everything is open and it's about that people at that time, how would it look? So it was to give you a free rein. But I also want to hear what Malene says. I think it's important to think about our urban development, our architecture. We try are thinking, let's build a thousand years ahead. So 2050 is just around the corner. So one thinks I'm too myopic, and the other... I can also relate to what you're asking. Exactly. I'm thinking, if we look at 2050, then one thing has happened that is different. There have have been water level increases. We also get what is called a vertical migration. We also get people who will move, we know all about that. But we also get the marine animals that will live where we live now. And some places we will manage with some coast insurance, and and other places we get integrated with other species. So we can start to think that this new reality will contain different types of inhabitants. And that is of course a completely different way to think about it. But what's cool is to try to understand what they want, what they need when we live together and understand each other from very different perspectives. Emilia, what do these generations need? Now we've done it so well, we could with the children we've put in the world. What do you think they can do and where do you think they will get some of these future problems and challenges? What do you think will happen if it is an education that is driven by them and a development? Something I find interesting is to hear how more and more people get a diagnosis. And it becomes a superpower. Greta Thunberg talks about her diagnosis as a superpower. It is of course a bit interesting to do, but what I find interesting is that we have to understand that we in reality have an enormous diversity of people. And one of the things I don't understand why we haven't had a part in the school system for a long time, but which will become even more important in the future, especially when we reach 2050, is that we have a subject called identity and community, or something that means something. Where you learn what it means to be a human and what it means to be a human in a community. So you learn something basic about how to have relationships, how we work together, how we create diversity, all that. We need to have the students in the classroom. Yes, we need to have the students in the classroom. And one of the places where you actually have started to do it a little bit, but indirectly, in an extremely indirect way, is that you have what you call the reverse classroom, which you train with today, where you learn, you incorporate what you have to learn at home through a program that is made for your own learning style. You can do it as much as you want, without anyone laughing at you, making mistakes, etc. You can be trained in a way that you feel safe and good, and actually learn what you need to learn. Then you come to the classroom. And what you use the classroom for, that is the community and the authority that the teacher is. Not the authority, but the authority. It is that you integrate the learning you have received and you use it in a community. And we will see much more of that in the future. Christiane? I agree with this subject, the social oriented, what would they say about people, general philosophy, all this is important. I think it can be combined with what we call technology understanding. Because technology understanding is a subject that we have already developed, where it is not just about technology, it is about understanding how we are in relation to technology. What are the consequences of digital bullying, for example? What does it mean if we have the screen or we choose to put it away? What is the difference in our proximity? I can hardly see these two things united in the same subject, because they are so dependent on each other. Yes, but it's clear that it's something that should be there from the 0th to the 9th and with the same weight as Danish mathematics. The 0th to the 9th, we have lifelong learning and it should be fluid and organic and have a thousand years perspective. Lars, I have a question for you. One can imagine that one is talking to an elderly person who says that the young people today do not learn to do grammar and they cannot do integral math. Where a young person can say back, okay, are you aware that there are 420,000 different AI programs on Hockingface? How good are you at playing on them, Uncle Ove? And Uncle Ove doesn't know a thing about that. My question is if you should have the attitude that anything that can be automated and is free of charge should be taken out of excluded from teaching, so that you just understand the concept, but in the end you should not be able to execute it. And then instead of learning to play on the piano of technologies that are constantly unfolding before our eyes. I will answer in a way you don't expect. I think that in intimate time, and I think there are some over-deliveries, some verbal over-deliveries that are very important, and I think you are right in that, you can easily remove all of that. But if we think about intimate time, it's also about trying to understand when the old one, either Ove or Olga, if we use these names, says something. I remember, I had a very, very old grandmother, who told me about the technologies that were happening in her time. And what made an enormous impression on me was her story about the toilet roll. It's a way of trying to understand when someone we know has experienced and tried to get this development, then our brains understand where we as humans have moved from. It's not that interesting how far you can calculate it, but it's very interesting to understand why people needed to know about technology and why they don't need it today. Do you have a comment, Christiane? I just think that what is being used a lot in the future is technology. It's easy to access and in many cases it's free. So it's democratized. What is being used a little is the near-life, human time, the biological body that is being released and disappears, so we are constantly replaced in the human race. So I think there is something very valuable in also to practice it in parallel with the technology development we have, so we can get the optimal coexistence between these very unique people. You should think about every single person is completely unique and uncopyable and quite rare with our own DNA, so far at least be copied into infinity. So I think we have a responsibility as humans to encourage this humanity, because it is the one that is rare, the machines are easy to make. Emilia? I just wanted to add that when we talk about work, then human beings have been used as a machine. They have been used as a machine that should be optimized, maximized, and optimized to produce as much as possible. Where you, at least according to those who know something about it, were in your collective society, you worked 2-4 hours a day and the rest of the time you just hung out, having fun with the others. That's what Rane Wildersley says in our program. Many people say that, also those who have written All Things Beginnings and so on. But what I find interesting is that we will see that the younger generation, the alphas, the betas, will insist on their work being meaningful and not machine-like. And that is how we have done it for a long time. So maybe we are in the process of making people make machines, in addition to making people machine-like. And it will be interesting to see what we actually do with our common co-habitants, existence, whatever we should call it. That is also Lars is also talking about, that we re-humanize people, because we become aware that this backache doesn't have any pain to do with, but it's because I have a girlfriend or something else. Christiane? But that's exactly what the machines wanted to help us with, namely to give us time to be human, to have feelings, to be poetic, to work less, to develop ourselves more as humans. So the best case scenario is that we use the machines to achieve the time, the place and the qualitative value in it. I will just round off with these three scenarios that we have to go back to. And now you are on the edge, so I say 1. We become people, but with help, a bit like with Flip Classroom and these things. We are completely connected to the machines. It is simply something we incorporate. We don't even know if we are in virtual reality or if we are in reality. We don't think about it as much as we might know with gamers, where the boundaries are completely wiped out. Or the machines are overtaking. I have just made a program with Melone Frank and Lars about future research, and she says that what keeps humanity back is the people. If we just had someone who was a little smarter and helped us, but she had no great faith in what the research could achieve, because they undermine everything smart that could be done. So, do we take over the machines, merge together, or do we strengthen humanity? I'm thinking, we just got this story up just before. And it shouldn't be what you want, it should be what you think. No, but you can say that it is in reality to try to say that we must get away from the fact that man is this machine and man can more afford to express some strange thoughts and ideas, while there must be someone who also makes sure that it all fits together effectively. Sianne? Well, if I say what I think and it's something other than what I want, then I'm not involved in influencing it in another direction. So I had to insist that I don't want us to absolutely merge with the machine. I don't think that's the best thing for us humans in the world. But that's why I can see that it could go in that direction, and we get more and more implementers. We are already totally controlled algorithms. And if we are, then we are just missing the coincidences, the serendipity moments, the magic, the meeting of a person we didn't plan to meet. I think the first ones are clear about how much algorithms control our lives already. So I think we should be very aware of not going into a future where everything is calculated, all algorithms and technologies are playing together. Are we still human? I can't stop thinking about that. I think that's what will be luxurious in the future. That's what we need to go to. We need to go to feedback fitness, we need to go to healthcare, we need to go to consultation. And I see so many of the young Emilie's who are sitting and knitting and crocheting and dabbling with things. So I have no doubt that we will get a reaction against the truth, because the other, the effective, as Alene was saying, fills. Can you take a stand on these three scenarios? You can both say what you think and what you hope for. I believe in the middle scenario, that we grow more together with technology. But what I hope for is that we do it in a way where the awareness is involved, where the truth is involved, where the human is involved. So we use it. I have just seen that an apple has come with a ski-ball, or something that reminds of a ski-ball. It's not a ski-ball, it just looks like it. It can be used in the dark. It's a VR headset. Yes, but you can look out. And the sun doesn't shine, and then you can put it on. But it's just that just that where they melt more and more together and where you almost get the texture in the air and such. What I think we will do is that we will become much more capable of making the machines to our users, that is for our service, to make it easier. I think it was fantastic to have a PA, it already exists for some, a virtual PA who says, now you should hear that your day is like this and like that, I'm going to call and make sure of that and so on. I would love that. Or even all my administration. I hate administration. It is simply something that many independent people just hate internally. And it could be cool that it could be done by something. But when I have to meet my friends or my children or be with my dog or a girlfriend or something like that, I want to feel that person. And I want to be able to keep that person if it is that they are very sad and feel lonely or that there are people I can call or invite to a party. When it, then it's not a computer or a pair of ski boots from Apple. So I think we're getting much better at differentiating between these things. And we get Optimus in any case. Elon Musk is also thinking that his robots will be able to do much more. And I agree with you, Emilia, but today, when it's getting worse, I would just like to have a robot that could ventilate my dog. Even though I love my dog all over the world. But what about rain days and the feeling of rain on your skin? That, that's why I as an old cynic think I'm missing it and I'm losing my humanity and I don't want it. Because suddenly you can't feel the right thing anymore. The more we get together with the machine, the more it knows, the more data it needs to give us the effective life we want. But there is always a consequence of putting our data in the hands of the machine. For example, self-driving cars. They know everything about us now. They know our sexuality. They know where we are. They know who we are with. There are sensors, cameras, microphones. It's part of going from the old petrol car that was car to live in an electric car. And it has consequences. And we have to be aware of that every time we bring in new technology. What does it mean for our society? Thank you for being here. Thank you. Generation Alpha was born between 2010 and 2024. It is the first generation, for whom the separation of the boundaries between artificial and biological intelligence is a basic requirement. Half of them have already had at least one virtual meeting, where they meet in Minecraft instead of at home with each other. Most of the Alpha children are born in India, China and Nigeria. And the generation is the richest ever, with 2.2 billion births. We went out to see the human machine with Emilie, Christiane and Malene. What do you think, Lars? Should we be afraid of becoming cyborgs who have completely lost our own humanity, ethics and morals and just put it all into a machine? I think several things. The first is of course that people have to adapt to the technologies they have developed themselves, step by step, over a very long time, especially the last 200 years since the start of the industrial revolution. It was really, really violent in the beginning, where people were out in the country and they had to stand by a collective farm on a factory. And it was the machine that was boss at the time. The collective farm could not stop the collective farm. You just had to do what the machine dictated you to do. At that point it said you had to do it and so on. And you had to stamp in and stamp out. And you had 28 minutes and 32 seconds of breakfast break. You can well imagine that I have a picture of Charlie Chaplin in front of me. Yes, I have that too. since then, we have seen that our coexistence with machines has become more and more to our advantage, I think. Can we not use that fantastic word? I love that word, that we can use the machine to re-humanize ourselves. To make ourselves even more humane than we almost were in the beginning. Yes, instead of standing outside at the common water place in the countryside and scrubbing clothes, you can realize yourself with yoga courses and Gaia and all sorts of other things. But something that is of course special in what we are looking into now is that new technology becomes hyper intelligent. I have seen predictions that it will be in 2050, which Christina does not want to talk about for so long, but in 2050 AI will be around 10,000 times as intelligent as humans. And I also have a presumption that at that time it will have both feelings and senses and moral instincts and probably also be self-confident. So it's a completely different type of technology. But overall, I think the most likely scenario is that it also frees us and gives us the opportunity to get higher up in what is called Maslow's pyramid of needs. I imagine we should almost have a third top on top the Maslow's pyramid of needs. I imagine that we will almost have a third top on top of the Maslow's pyramid of needs. Yes, in any case, the higher the degree of people getting the opportunity to get up there, the more interesting this top becomes. You are completely right about that. We could make a separate program about that.-realization and other things are a very good field to develop. I am positive about it. But the discussion about how we find our own life and adapt our lives with these new technological capacities, it does not stop. Especially not because technology will develop so extremely quickly. Yes, and it manipulates us more, as we have also had other programs with, among other things, Niklas Brentbog with common animals. Algorithms and all sorts of things that lead us to places where we might not have wanted to be if we could see the big picture ourselves. And I hope that we at least, also our program with Personal AI and Kindir, takes the power back, so that it is us who decide how the top of the Maslow's law of spirituality should look like. Yes, and what happens, I think, is that technology develops much faster than our own ability to change our lives in a reasonable way. And that is to say, as he said, with theseimuli, suddenly we have access to the food you can buy on a gas station, which is insanely unhealthy and it takes a very long time for people to change their culture so they don't die from it. So we will always be behind with our change, but our change will always be in progress. So, like I don't want to be able to live without my glasses, we won't be able to live without having a body with technology in 2050? That's how it is, yes. And is it fast or slow, this? We all have an incredible interest in living longer and better. Yes, I would say that the theme is our ability to adapt as humans to technology. So I would say that it goes much slower than the technology itself. Yes, you are right. Is it difficult or difficult to invest in? I think we should look for something that is easy and that you don't want to get a brain chip in your head. So it shouldn't be too invasive. There are lots of new business opportunities all the time, which are about how to avoid being misled by the technology and instead use it to our advantage. And that's all possible from mindfulness courses and all kinds of things where we try to find ourselves and find out how we get the good life and the better life with technology instead of getting a worse life with technology. So rich, sustainable, clever? I would say clever. And is it a supertrend? The persistent adaptation to technology that changes so easily is a supertrend.

The program that curiously explores all the technological developments that will turn your, mine and our lives upside down. Your host is futurist Liselotte Ly the CEO from Microsoft. I have Lise Ryval, who is the CEO of Metas. And I have you, Gregory Christensen. You are the CEO of ProRoom. And together with Lars Twede, we are going to look at how new technological advances are completely going to change retail as we know it. The Supertrends machine is a dynamic timeline constructed by the world's leading experts in collaboration with artificial intelligence. It predicts when the groundbreaking technologies of the future will come into play. And welcome to you Lars Tvid. Where are you now? I am in Switzerland, where I can inform you that we have snow and we have started skiing in the weekends. Have you already been out on the slopes? Not yet. Pardon me? You haven't been out on the slopes yet? No, not yet. No. OK. Well, the floor is yours. Shall I go into the... Yeah, thank you very much. I will go into the timeline. So what we have here is, this is how it looks in our system. So we have about 20,000 innovations mapped and they go back in history, but also go into the future. So we have about 4,000 predictions for the future. I'm not going to take you through all 4,000, but I have picked some that are relevant to the retail sector. The first one is that by 2025, over 10% of retailers offer virtual fitting rooms. A a virtual fitting room is obviously one way you don't actually have to change clothes, but you can see how you would appear with different kinds of clothes. Also the same year, 2025, at least 30% of retailers have a virtual storefront in the Omniverse. So the Omniverse is where you can advertise and sell on many different platforms. And so this prediction is that by 2025, at least 30% of retailers have a virtual storefront in the Omniverse, so in different places. Then we go two years further out in 2027. Then you'll have AI driven personal shopping assistance that will really take off. And that means that when you come into a shop, a warehouse, there will be a little shopping assistant and you can just tell it what you want and then it will guide you around and show you where to go, what your choices are, etc. I think we all know the situation where we come into a shop we are not very familiar with and we can't find the stuff and that is actually addressable with technology. In 2027, you will have federated personal AI used for virtual focus groups. So I think many people won't understand what that means, but just with the first federated means that you get information about people, but without actually knowing who these people are. So it's anonymous. Personal AI is one of the biggest growth teams for the next couple of years. I think the next two or three years, lots and lots of people will have personal AI that works as their coach, as their guide, as their inspirator, as their education support, as organizer and everything like that. And that personal AI will get to know you very well. And that means that if you then get federated data from a lot of personal AI, then you can actually run virtual focus groups where you can see how all these different people probably would react to different promotions and prices and so on. So it's actually a very interesting area that is developing. Also in 2007, over 10% of major retailers offer NFT-based loyalty programs. So this is blockchain. And also again in 2017, most retailers use live video broadcasts for promotions. So this is something that some companies obviously do today, but it will become more widespread. Same year, over 10% of clothing retailers offer smart mirrors. So smart mirrors is obviously, it's a mirror where you see yourself, but then there you see yourself in different, for instance, dressing and so on. There's a point down to that in the fitness sector where you have smart mirrors for doing sport. But here it's obviously for being able to try out different things in the shop without actually taking it on. 28 over 90% of retailers offer direct purchases through social media. So you are on social media, you see a product and then you can just click to buy right there. In the same year, 50% of major retailers accept payment in multiple digital currencies. So this is more a bit on the success of digital currencies than on specifically what happens in the retail sector. So what we've seen is that digital currencies have been spreading out and it's like shooting roots all the time. 29, the year after, virtual reality shopping assistance take off. So you're talking to a virtual person in the shop. And I think I can see in some shops this becoming very big. So it's actually kind of a chat, but a visualized one. Same year, in 2019, over 50% of major retailers offer virtual store tours. This is something we know, for instance, from real estate for sale that you can go in and see how it looks. But it would be, in many cases, very nice to be able to walk through the shop before you actually decide to visit it. So, you get a feel for what it has and where the stuff is. In 2019, 10% of retail chains offer robotic delivery. We also have some forecasts for drones, flying drones. I think they are more doubtful because it depends a lot on local legislation. But these small things that drive on the road, I think, have a clear path forward. In 2019, also, over 10% of retail purchases are made by personal AI. And that means that your personal AI knows exactly what you you want and it simply goes in and buys stuff for you. So I think this is a very radical prediction but it's based on a broad expectation that personal AI will be so widespread that it will actually start doing these kind of things for you. In 2030, at least 30% of all retail chains have invested in metaverse real estate. So that is obviously getting shops and other stuff in the metaverse. In 2030 also, most major retails deploy hyperlocal strategies. So hyperlocal is about doing fulfillment very close to where the customer is. Same year, the majority of retail chains use micro-fulfillment centers. And then in 31, over 90% of major retailers use AI to optimize store layouts. That is, to me, kind of a no-brainer, that AI can not only observe what happens in the store, but can also be aware of how weather, events, holidays and so on impact how people behave in the stores. In 31, again, 50% of all larger retailers have virtual reality pop-up events. So going to the next one in 31, the majority of retail companies use green delivery options. This is something we see spreading in many different sectors, including for instance in international shipping, where you can also increasingly choose green delivery. In 31 also, at least 10% of retail brands exist only in the metaverse. That's kind of interesting. So you have a brand that actually isn't present in the physical world at all, only in the metaverse. In 2030, 30% of retailers launch products through virtual reality shows. And now here's a photo of a lady with a very big thing on. But of course, the trend is to watch much smaller headsets for going into virtual reality, including glasses or perhaps even contact lenses. In 34 robotic store assistants are employed in most large retail stores. And there have been some examples of this going very wrong, so it's early days, but for sure, this is something that will also come. In 41, now we are pretty far out in the future, most major retailers use installed 3D printers to respond to customer orders. That means that you can get products, shoes, whatever you want, a cup, something like that, 3D printed. You can order it beforehand or it 3D prints while you wait because these printers are getting really, really fast. And then the last one I have is by 2042, most retailers offer integration with personal AI. And that means that the personal AI that people carry around interface directly with software that the retailer has. And this is a very big thing. So the last thing I just want to show you is that if you scan this and you can get access to the data I've just talked about and try it out for yourself. Thank you very much. One retail trend expected to shape the future of customer experiences is the concept called Fidgetal. This is a blend of the physical and digital aimed at incorporating digital features into the physical shopping experience creating a hybrid of convenience, service and autonomy for the customer. Currently this might take the form of self-service options where you can shop in showrooms without interacting with a physical person, or home-based augmented reality solutions that allow you to virtually furnish your living room before purchasing the items. In the future that says, what would the primary purpose of VR, virtual reality shopping, be like a complete shop in the metaverse? It seems a little cumbersome to emulate real stories compared to a more digital focus. So will we really replicate the shop and the desks that we are sitting at today or should we think in other terms when you think about the metaverse? That's a question and then I can introduce the panel as well for an answer. Maybe they have a better answer. Or do you have an answer, Hans? I do have an answer which is also a comment because I think the question is really excellent because sometimes we make the mistake of thinking that we should replicate what we're used to in a new media. So I think that for some experiences it would be very nice to see a replication in 3D of the shop as it looks. But in other cases, it's much better with an interface which is optimized for digital. Thank you very much. And do you have a comment on that? Yeah, maybe I was just actually thinking a little bit. We just announced new features in Teams in Microsoft last week. And actually you can do a virtual room, you know, with chairs and you can put people in there and you can actually see if people raise their hand. So I was thinking that at least, you know, you could actually build a really nice shop online and then you can buy the stuff and get it out physically home to you. But you can just build any shop you want because you don't have the same sort of guard rails and stuff you need to take care of when you do it digitally. So I was just seeing this team's room for me and who wants to buy my jacket and stuff like that. I thought that was what happened. But I couldn't help thinking that with these gamers coming up now and they have all these things, do we really need to sit again virtually by chairs and tables in the future and the same stores? Can't we create some insane where we can play the main role going down the fashion line where everybody is shouting, thinking that we look fantastic. I don't know, something else than the shop format. But of course we could do that as well. It's because the first cars, they look a lot like horse wagons because we couldn't imagine that they could look otherwise. Likewise, the driverless cars now, they are very traditional, and soon we will see them as driving around as a completely different unit. Lise? I think to help consumers actually to move from a physical store into the metaverse, I think it could be logical to make the metaverse in the beginning something that looks alike, because they will recognize and we will move them quicker. Also, when you look at how we moved from the physical store into the digital world, just on our websites, I mean, don't ever do the same as it is in store. So there are both ways. I think it's a good idea to move people, actually to make people aware, what is this I can buy, but on the other hand to make them shop, I think you need to use other tools. Gregory, do you have a comment on this one? Yeah, I think that familiarity always comes with in the beginning and then it changes as more technologies get involved. So yeah, the gamer generation, they might want to shop in a different way. So you have to follow your target group. What are they interested in? How are they learning on TikTok and all the social medias and so on? And then it will develop. Just a very short comment, because I was also just thinking, on the iPhone on the iPhone we have this, you know, when we have to call someone, we hit this, you know, old icon of a phone. And if we ask kids, you know, under 10, they have never seen a phone, they don't know what it is, and they wouldn't know how to go to the bank or to the post office, and maybe we'll end up in the same place, right? Nobody knows actually what a shop was in the old days. I think so. When we stand in 2050, we should have made the leap. So, Mette, now that I have you, what do you think is going to be the big key digital transformations? You have a lot of stuff going on with artificial intelligence. I remember we have already done a podcast on super trends together and I remember you had this example of an Italian shop. Yes, but I think maybe three things just to take it from the top. So I think one thing is the sustainability promise that we all have to the world will be a major part of retail moving forward. And maybe we cannot see it that much, but it will be how we produce and how we actually deliver and how we optimize our supply chains. There will be a lot of AI in that also delivering the green. And I would like to comment on that because isn't it like we have a lot of returns right now? Sometimes a shirt is actually going out there nine times before it finally finds its client. And that's a lot of driving back and forth. Yeah, so a lot of AI into solving that. So Microsoft is promising to fix that. We really need to solve that. So that's the first part. Then there's the very personalized part. That's the shoe example. I'll come back to that. And then there's the crazy experience that we just spoke of. You know, what can you actually do in a virtual room and also in a combined virtual and physical room. And on this very personalized part, we have a shoe client in Italy that has made it so that you can go into a virtual room and together with a digital twin that is you know emulating how your shoe will going to look in 3D you can build your own shoes and this is probably not for the many this is probably for the few but it shows a little bit of what can we actually do with technology. Japan Airlines has launched an experimental rental service named Anywhere Anywhere. Here, travelers provide their body measurements a few weeks before departure and arrive at the destination to find a wardrobe filled with perfectly sized outfits waiting for them. This concept hints at a future where vacation shopping starts even before you leave home. It also points towards a future where circular economy and 3D printing offer eco-friendly ways to travel light. You know one of them is called Maya and the other one is just called Bot. Yeah. No, we have our own avatar. So we have a lot of stuff to cover. I think I'll start out with actually what we call the beauty bot or a digital assistant and that we're building right now as we speak, that is going to help all our talented employees in our stores to be, even if you just started 14 days ago, you can be as knowledgeable, as talented, knowing everything about health, about beauty, about health products, beauty products, because you have your digital assistant next to you. And for that, Lisa, I'm just going to complimentary you with that, that is not stupid people, but unexperienced people, they can be lifted by AI by 43%, and very clever clever people it's only 19%. So we're actually closing the experience gap which I think is fantastic in the retail area where it's so hard to recruit and maintain staff. For META's where service and the personal advice it's such a big and very important value then for us to actually make them even more talented and also self-confident in the meeting with the customer is really important. And this beauty bot will be developed as well so that our consumers can meet it online and get that good advice on whatever trend they have seen. And not only good advice as a written advice, do this, do that, do this, but also showing exactly what products there are. So I want smoky eyes. I want smoky eyes, then it will say, okay, you need to start with this and then it will show you seven products. Then you do that and then it will show you another seven products and then finally you do this. And by the way, if you want it even better, you could use this to make it stay all day long. So this kind of thing. And then you and I discussed and you said, okay, but won't it make you then a small video on exactly where you use actually the person himself or herself that is asking that question and show it it showing it that I wanted on my face I want to play wanted it on her face and I had to say that's not right now in the plans, but probably you're right. Yeah, it will come. I mean, of course we want to see the smokey eyes on our own face. So we know where we're heading with all these videos. I think L'Oreal did something with the lipstick, didn't they? I actually think they do have a virtual try on. They have virtual try on. But that brings me to the avatar, Lizzie. You were also talking about that we should all have an avatar. And I guess that's really interesting because if you have me as an avatar, you can use me as a focus group without having to ask me. And that's true. That was because, I mean, in Metas, we are in the situation that 1.9 million members, I mean we know 80% of our consumers very well. We have known them over the past 10 years, we know exactly what they buy, we know when they are pregnant and when they get children and when they are close to dying. So that's a lot of data that of course we can we use today and we do believe we personalize and we talk about personalization in Metas today and I think we are pretty good but in the future we're not talking about four or five or six segments that we are personalizing our things. We are talking about one single club member is probably a segment itself. And this club member, we can start producing products, services exactly matching the single club member. And I think that will be the future. And then we were discussing another thing about all these bots, because they are bots, they are machines. And we actually had a visit from the vice president of Universal Robots and he said, I think you're making a huge problem here for humanity because we can't control our relationship with these bots. It should be forbidden. Machines should be called machines and people should be called machines. And then I spoke to some of these gamers who said, but in 2050 we're going to have virtualism like we have racism today and then people who think that virtual people, artificial people who are not real, they are like we are being racist today, which I thought was very interesting, exciting. So Gregory, if we look towards 2050, you are creating some hybrid between virtual and real, so we won't really notice what is what. Can you try to explain a little bit? Yeah, so just like web shops have their advantages compared with the physical store, well, both are trying to learn from each other. So what does a webshop do that you can bring into the physical store? Well, for one, a webshop is always on. It's there when you need it. When you come into the website, it has product recommendations that are really sharp, depending on what you've been looking at. So we're trying to bring these things into the physical store. People can let themselves in, they should get communication when they want it, they can chat in the way that they want with a chatbot or with a real person or these kind of things. So it's a hybrid and I believe in a future where the advances that are made in technology will come into brick and mortar stores, but also more and more the virtual things are trying to give you the experience. This is augmented reality, virtual reality, the fitting rooms. All these things are things that you traditionally went to a physical store to experience, but you can do more and more of that online as well. When I met you this morning, you said I had how many sensors in my fingers? Yeah, it is very hard to work out the product experience because in your fingertip, each of them, you have 3000 receptors that have been developing in millions of years and they can experience pressure, texture, heat, cold and so on. So there's a long time in 2050, who knows what is possible then, but you would have to have, it takes a lot to connect these things. Everybody has an iPhone, but it only has a few dozen receptors. So compared with your fingertip, it is still far behind. But it's a combination, right? And also, you know, the self-driving car, so it will come out and I can walk in. And Lars was talking about that it would actually start shopping without me saying yes. Is that true? Well, I mean, if your fridge is saying, well, he likes to have oat milk in the morning and now it's getting empty, that is a possibility to allow these things. We automate more and more of our life so that we can focus on our creative things, what we want to do. And yeah, everywhere in retail you have from the storage room and the logistics to product ordering, all of that automation is moving into the store. So in some stores now in the US they have, for example, a counting robot called Tally that is driving around and counting how many Coca-Cola's are there left. We need to get more from the storage. These automations move more and more into the consumer's life. And it's all about convenience. It's all about speed of delivery and ease of sale. So if things get easier and more convenient. It's a winner future. And then we have the whole storytelling part where we still need to go out there. We don't know what we need, but we actually just want to have this emotional hock. We were talking about the price of a coffee. It varies from one euro to 10 euro, according to the story that comes with it. Mette? Yeah, that was... I can't remember who it was. It was Ian Whistler. Yeah, talking about that if you just go and pay for the coffee you do at home, and it costs something between one and four Danish kroner. But if you buy it in a cafe, it costs 10 to 20 times as much. It's still just a cup of coffee. Someone brings it in a cup, but it's still just coffee. But the experience that comes with it. And can we create an expensive experience? I mean, I know for sure the gamers are paying a lot of money online. But would we do it within retail? Yeah, I think just to give an example, I heard that Nike are beginning to create stores where you come to train. So you go in there, you train and you can get a lot of information about how your training is and how you're running and which kind of equipment you might be needing in order to get the most out of your training. And if you have some goals you want to achieve, run a marathon, run really quickly, whatever it might be, row, I don't know, very long, you will get a lot of information and good advice. And of course, you know, they will at some point also just put it into your shopping basket on the way out and then you can just click, you know, what you want and here we go. So that's an example of also how the shops will no longer be a shop. It's going to be experience. Yeah. Lise, any add-ons? So people already shop a lot online, but when they come to the shop, they go as a gang and they try out things and they have fun. Yeah, and I think especially in our business, probably as well in sports, but also in health and beauty. Metas wants to be the one-stop shop for health and beauty. And shopping beauty, it is a kind of a dream. We are helping people to dreams come true, to show themselves as the best variety. And a dream is not necessarily going into a web shop or going into a store. It can also with augmented reality, it can become much of virtual reality. It can become a real dream. So imagine what we can create with augmented reality and virtual reality within the beauty business or even within health where it's another reality we want to show, but it's still very important and very close to people's heart. So I think that there's a huge potential there. I don't know how we're going to grab it, but I do believe that there's a huge potential for all of us in creating these universes in another way. Let's take another question from the audience. Cryptocurrencies, when can we pay with those? People have them stuck now in their pockets. So will you be able to pay with that in the pro room? If they get broadly adopted enough, they will. Just like everywhere now Google and Apple Pay is there, cryptocurrency could become a possibility just like that in the future. Again, it's all about ease and convenience to be fast. I remember when we spoke last time, I also said that it's super important that the technology is mature enough and that it's broadened out enough before we use it for consumers, it really needs to work. So that would be my answer to that one. Lars, do you have a comment on crypto? Yeah, so my comment to crypto is that there are two sides to crypto. First of all, of course, is digital currency, which is a thing that works. And the other thing is an enormous amount of expectations of crypto being used for other things. So I think for membership bonus, crypto will be very suitable in digital wallets. But this is not something that is really flying yet. So I think it's a question mark how well it will do, but I'm kind of tilting in the direction that this will also become very popular. Here are three ways robotics are expected to transform the future of shopping experiences. 1. Expect to see personal shopper robots guiding you, complementing your choices and making recommendations for your look based on your budget, purchase history and current fashion trends. These robots will greet you at the entrance and may be rented by the minute or offered as a complimentary service as part of the store's branding. 2. Delivery robots in shopping malls will dutifully bring your purchases to a collection point near the exit so you don't have to carry them around. Or they might just deliver them straight to your home now they're at it. 3. As you leave the store, robots will initiate casual conversations to gather immediate feedback about your shopping experience. This information can be used to advise future customers or provide store managers with real-time insights to improve on. And then some people in the audience are again posing a very interesting question. Once we have our avatars, Elise, and we have all these bots, will we need to do social media posts or will we just talk to segments of one and just have the dialogue there and then forget about all this information overload? Well, in a way, from a Meta's perspective, that would be a dream that we could communicate with all our customers directly instead of having to go via social media or other channels. I think it will be a tough work for us to compete with some of these guys. They are worldwide, they are huge, they have a lot of money and they are ready to spend it. So to actually take over for Facebook or Instagram or TikTok, I think will be tough. Honestly, I would love to. And I think we would do our utmost to just really be able to talk directly to the consumer in a very personalized way. And I'm pretty sure we will succeed also, but I don't think it's instead of social media, for example, or other very strong channels where the consumers, I mean, they can bring content and in a different way, different content to the consumer. So. And I guess also we are social beings, aren't we, Mette? So we still need to connect. We still need to come out and meet other people and do stuff together. And that is what some of these, I don't know, new shops and virtual things. You can actually be together in a virtual world as well, which all the gaming is doing and showing us works quite good. So yes, we need the social relationships. We need to come out and meet people. And that's also why the experience of going shopping or whatever it will be called in the future is still very important and will still exist, I believe. Gregory, so in the old days we had Tupperware parties and your vision is these driverless shops that are coming out. And I imagine that people are just having a party in there, trying stuff on, taking pictures and there will be nobody there or will you be on virtually to assist people or how do you imagine this future of shopping party, not the party bus but the party shop? It can be hybrid, so all the things that you like when you go to an art gallery opening and they have a live DJ and flashy lights and they're showing you their nice art pieces. Well, in the future with self-driving vehicles, with movable showrooms, you can create these experiences with an ease and you can promote it in a local area and say, okay, we have an event here. I believe that people are very social. So I think that one thing that you want is attention when people are posting and so on. And when people can have experiences together in shopping, if you can facilitate that, just like they're doing today with live shopping, well then you can win. We are for example looking into concepts where if you take your girlfriend with you out to shop furniture, well then you get a free exclusive coffee or something, an add-on to create an experience that people can enjoy together. And yeah, I believe with self-driving stores, with all these future possibilities, well, yeah, then all this is going to happen. So we will still, despite having an environmental crisis, also shop in the future, not least because we enjoy it. What I would like to look at is that we have a lot of shops that are dying at the moment because you get all these great service in the shop and you try all these things and then you say, thank you for a great service. I will now go online and find someone who will sell it to me at half the price. And then you illoyally buy half the price from someone who's not putting any energy into the showroom experience. So I would love to know how my thoughts can be read. So in this shop, Disilordi fell in love with this product. He might not have bought it there, but there should be a kickback to the people who are creating noise and fun and go out in the physical rooms. I don't know if it's possible, but we have a business model that is broken, I guess. Yeah, I think the kickback model is going to be super complex. So I don't really think I believe that. I believe that you need to create the experience for people to buy it while they're there, back to the coffee. Okay, so, but Mehta, you have a great position in that sense. Well, we have a great position, but I mean, we could be the one. I mean, we've been there for so many years and actually, pricing is not in the center of the value that you get from Meta. That's a good advice. But seeing competitors around really lowering prices, I mean, either you sit back and you cross your fingers that people will just keep on shopping because they are loyal, or you figure out what is your way around this and how can you actually compete to some certain extent underpricing, because consumers will always be keen on getting the best price. I mean that is in our souls and in our bodies so you need as a retailer you cannot say I only give good advice then at least you want to be for the few. If that is your business model, you are for the few. And that is probably possible, but if you like Metas is for everybody, you cannot say that price is not important for us. You need to find your way. Maybe you don't have to be the cheapest in the market. You mix it. The price perception needs to be mixed with services and what else you have that you can offer. Yeah, but I just think, just to give a comment on that, I totally agree, price is super important, but we have models where we see that people pay a lot more to actually experience or get a product. When you go to the cinema, it's quite expensive. You could just sit home at Netflix and see a lot of the movies, but still you go to the cinema because it is an experience and you go with your friends and you also have the popcorn and what have you and back to the coffee. So there's something there to crack. But of course, price is important, but experience is going to be more important, maybe moving forward. And then you have your loyalty programs, which is also important. Which is also very, very important. And then maybe also, you know, I saw that IKEA has made something. I've not tried it out, but you can actually, when you're looking at furniture at IKEA, you can bring them home on your mobile, because if you have sort of pictures and stuff, you can try to model how will this look at home. So there's also this bringing home or bringing into the closet or bringing to the makeup purse or to see if it fits with what do I have. And if you're very good at that also, then you're also helping out in a way where I believe you can keep the customers and make them buy. So it's actually really to keep on focusing on that customer journey and making sure that you are relevant and you are offering the best product at the right time at an okay price. I mean being there and also understanding your consumer, understanding what are the troubles that make them not shop right away and then it could even be be like it could even be for makeup get a trial I mean bring the product home try it at home come back if you don't like it that is a possibility and and we need to go very far in the business models that we have today and think out of the box to understand what is necessary to keep consumers loyal to us in the future. I guess what we see is, I was in Amsterdam recently and you can go around, you can taste all these Gouda cheeses and you can fix and you can, they even sell drinking water with different tastes. So there's so much you can do and you play the central role in all of it. So I guess what the digital thing can do is it making us to move from consumers to co-creators or prosumers. That is at least making it interesting to engage. Do you have any thoughts finally on that? Yeah, I think the survival of the brick and mortar depends not on being the price sensitivity, but the value adds that you give. And these can take all kinds of forms. It can be having the best recommendations, having the best staffs, having the best customer experience, having the best tangibles. And definitely it helps if you have unique products that are not sold by 25 other web shops. So I think I at least see more of this direct to consumer strategy where a lot are selling directly because they can and because they can put their products out there and let people experience them and then buy them directly. So how many people think we have as many physical shops in 2050 as today? Put your hands up. One? Three? Okay, so what do you think about that? That's very few physical shops. What do you think, Lisa? Well, I mean, at Metos we do not see the trend that stores are becoming less interesting, simply. So we are not closing stores, actually the opposite. We are opening stores. So this year we'll be more stores than we were last year. And this is because we see consumers, they want the real experience, they want the advice, they want to have the experience of touching, smelling, what you cannot do actually online. But I'd say if we did not have our online channel and if we did not manage to grow our online channel and the online experience and the app and all the other platforms that we have, then we would not be interesting and we would lose also traffic to the stores. So this is kind of a universe that we have built that has become very strong and it shows that actually the digital world is bringing traffic into the physical stores and our physical stores is bringing traffic into our digital Metas world. Mette, thank you very much for attending. Lise, Gregory and Lars in Switzerland, so great you were there there let's give them a big hand of applause thank you for listening to this episode of super trends if you have comments questions or suggestions please feel free to write to us on social media also remember to share and like like. The program is produced by Liselotte Lyngsø, who as always has been in the studio together with Lars Tvede. The fun facts were researched and voiced by Dennis Riven.

You discover several thousand times as many permutations as you knew in the past, that you would have spent decades on finding out in two weeks. It's because they send what gets the uranium to the poorer countries. It's not because they don't get uranium, it's just because they don't leave it in Switzerland. Then you can say that it has always been one of the very large companies, which has also been involved in pulling the whole industry in one direction. It's simply the coolest thing I've ever heard. This is Supertrends, the program where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is one of the most difficult challenges the world has to face to ensure that we have a future. Our expert Liam Litt also fortunately thinks that we should work more regeneratively and build, not just just minimize damage, but actually build up again and contribute to the common good. So look forward to an episode where we will talk about sustainability. Lars, if I start by defining sustainability, then it a practice or method that allows us to maintain a long-term production without damaging the environment or exploiting the resources that are necessary for future generations. It is a approach that is used, and typically it is used for the environmental, economic or social. So sustainability, Lars. Now we have to do it. Yes, we have to. And it is something that you focus more on when you think you have the advice for it, you can say. So if you think you think about Europe and the West, then the time in our history when we were least sustainable was probably in the first half of the 18th century. You read reports about the earthen soup in London, for example, where they just had coal everywhere, in their homes. And the water was so thick that sometimes they could only see a few meters forward. And the Thames river was so polluted at a time when there was a ship that was sinking and people died of poisoning. And it stank so much that they had problems in parliament with the smell of shit, to put it like that, from this river. It was horrible. So in that way, in our part of the world, we experience a much cleaner world than then. But then there are other countries that are going through the industrialization process that we went through. Typically it goes downhill and when the economy reaches different levels, there are turning points in how we treat air, water, land and so on. I know we're going to talk about regenerative in a bit, but something we also talk about, Lars, is the precision economy. That we get so good data now that you can make such a digital twin. And for me, one of the completely laid-back, low-hanging fruits is to look at all the braids we make that does not create value for anyone at all. So I was out at Novo Nordisk and see all those many insert sheets they put in the packages that do not read a damn thing and everyone does does it because you just have to do it, make an invoice. It's like an example, or our transport where the cars are 95% of the time. Or that you produce, we have had land breaches several times, produce a whole chicken, even though you only need to eat the cooling law. Why are you not just enough to break the law forward? Or in relation to heat, that there is heat where we are, indoor climate, heat adapted to the individual, but then we turn off the heat where we are not. So all that we are running on autopilot. I just saw that Barcelona, Helsinki, they are now in the process of making some digital twins in their city, so that you can see how the traffic flow is, where there are abused resources, where we can screw up, where we can screw down. And it hasn't been a bad will, but we just haven't had the eye for these things that are just standing there and whining. And then it's like they've landed between the desks, there's no one doing anything. I think that's a really uplifting place to look at. Yes, and it's part of the whole story we're going to talk about in this episode. That there are many, many different things to do in different places. And because most people are not experts, it's easy to say, if it's about some very few things, then we do it, then everything gets better. So in my view, it's about what is seemingly clean. We want clean air, we want clean water. When I was little, you had to check the coal levels before you went to the bathroom, because there was a lot of coal pollution from the cloacas on the Danish beaches. Today you can swim in Copenhagen. We don't want to have large paddocks where things are hoping to get better. That's one thing. The other is biodiversity, which is both how many different species there are, but also that we have enough individuals of every kind to make it actually sustainable in a way that it doesn't get too much input. And the third is of course global warming, some do not call it pollution, but it is at least part of the environmental problems. And I have such an example that is a bit of a mess for me, and that is where people can simplify things. So I came out here in a taxi and then... In a taxi? And we're talking about sustainability? Oh God. Well, but then he sits and talks about sustainability with the driver and then he says, well, we just have to have sun and wind and electric cars and then everything is fine. And it's such an example where people have such a very simple point of view on it. So if the entire Danish energy supply came from windmills, we would use the whole of Jutland and make it into an industrial park with windmills. And if it all came from solar panels, we would make the entire Schelland into it. And there are a lot of people who think we are almost at home with it, but 90% of the Danish energy consumption Denmark today comes from burning things. People sometimes confuse how much these technologies are caused by power supply with what they cause by the entire energy supply. Globally, solar accounts for about 4% of the world's energy supply. And globally, in the last 20 years, there has not been any increase in what is called sustainable energy in global energy supply. Because quite likely there will be more windmills and solar panels, but then dams, i.e. water and biomass. This has also lost market share because it cannot scale. Global energy supply is growing a lot, about 2.6% per year. When you build these large energy machines, they last for about 20 years, then they are waste, they must be scrapped. You can reuse maybe 30% of the metals that have been used to produce them, but the rest will be used for mining. So if just solar and wind, and I'm just using this as an example, where sometimes you see it as an example, so if just solar and wind were to take over the global energy consumption, which would only make fossil fuel to be unchangeable, we would have to double it in the next ten years. Today it is about 10% of global metal production. If we double it in ten years, then it will be 70% of the global metal production. Then there is not enough for everything else. There will be many more mines, but that will not be invested in. And there are many so-called ISG filters, when people invest, which filter the mines. I know that myself as an investor. Last week we were looking at investing in some South American companies and then we said, where in the world are the mines? And they are sorted by environmental considerations. But it is what you need to make these solar winds and so on. So there are often such... It seems like there are some strange things, and I really think it's a difficult subject, because when you stand outside and can judge, well, where is it you should put in? Who are the good ones, who are the bad ones? The whole thing in our society is about hero and scourge, and it makes it really difficult to navigate in these areas. And so this is quite simple, like a Korba film with hero and scourge, but in reality it is very complex with cost-benefit analyses. If we do one thing, we can't do anything else and which order should we do it and so on. But Lars, we have talked a lot and now I know there are some out there who are thinking about fusion energy. We don't have to get into that. But I would say, try to listen to some of our other energy programs. But when does it happen? We need to do something in the transition period, Lars. I have a timeline, so I have predictions for everything possible. I will just say one more thing about this energy transition. There is a geologist called Simon Michaud who has made some huge calculations about what it would say if we made a total transition to sustainable energy until 2050. And one of the things he is expecting is that we will use 5 times as much coal as the known reserves in the world. And that would be 189 years of coal production. But we will also need 1700 years of coalt and 29.000 years of production of germanium. So, realism and a more complex view of things is very important. So, you would like to hear the timeline? I would love to hear the timeline, because I would like to hear how we will get out safely on the other side. And before you start it, Lars, will it end well? It ends super happily. It just takes a little longer than people think. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, who in combination with artificial intelligence, gives a signal when future groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. Yes, we start in 2024, when the world's first two-stroke engine will be made of ammonia. That is, where we use ammonia as fuel. And that is something you can use nuclear power plants, but also solar and wind to make fuel, and it can be used to make ammonia, and then it can be used as fuel in ships for example. So it is an important breakthrough there. 2025 we have a prognosis for that you can actually make a train that runs on Brent, which with all operating costs and operating costs is competitive with diesel-based trains. But in 2025 we expect to have the first radiolysis-based Brent are burned. In Saudi Arabia, they have a large plant that in 2025 will produce 4 gigawatt solar energy. That corresponds to Denmark's electricity supply. Not energy supply. But that's a lot. In 2025 there will be a nano nuclear power plant that uses nuclear waste as fuel. We have all these thinners with nuclear waste, and there are scientists who say they can transmute it to something that is harmless. But then there are some entrepreneurs who say we shouldn't do that, because we can actually use it as fuel. In the USA, Bill Gates is involved in an experiment with building reactors, where they think that if it works, they can supply the USA with all their energy in several hundred years, based on what is called the traveling wave, where they use what is left. 2026 also expects to use a coal mine for geothermal plants for the first time. Where you draw heat from the underground. I live in Switzerland, and it's a very big thing there. I've been there myself. But there are also some who want to use super strong lasers, which are actually developed to make nuclear fusion. They want to use them to make geothermal holes, and they say they think they can make a 15-20 km deep hole in 100 days. And then we open up for the ultra deep geothermal, which can be very interesting. There are also some others that say that fracking, that is the way where you make small cracks in the clips to get more gas and oil up. When you're done with that, you can actually use the structure you have been made to make geothermal. Then we have 2027, the world's first transcontinental solar energy network. It is Singapore that will get something from Australia primarily. And then, if you have mentioned nuclear fusion, then in the event of 2027 we have an experimental nuclear fusion reactor that run for half an hour. But Lars, will it be sustainable if we make a lot of new stuff in the world based on all these free energy sources? Aren't we just white? We have to be sustainable all the way around. But I think we should take as a starting point that the world will use a lot more energy in the future, because most people live in deep alienation. 2030 the first commercial thorium atom reactor will be in operation, and several different experiments in Norway. Denmark has Copenhagen Atomic, which is made by some. China has one out in the desert. India has also started. We have thorium enough for about 100,000 years of use, and it is much safer and makes much less waste than traditional nuclear reactors. And then we jump far ahead. There is a prognosis in 2030, so costs for making sustainable fuel are falling to about 2 dollars per kilo, so it is not far from 15 kroner per liter. But there is much more power in the Brent than in the petrol, so it is cheap. And then there are a lot of prognoses about batteries, so batteries become more and more efficient. The last one I would say is the the elephant in the room is nuclear fusion, because nuclear fusion is the most extraordinary technology after AI, in my opinion. So there is a nuclear fusion plant called Helion, which has announced that they have signed a contract with Microsoft to deliver 28 years of nuclear four years from now. According to the World Economic Forum, about half of global GDP depends on nature. It's a crucial incentive to protect it from money talks. Suddenly, environmental damage and loss of biodiversity can be converted into a language in coins and ears. Here is an example. The International Monetary Fund has calculated that a vote is about 2 million dollars each, based on its ability to absorb CO2 and its contribution to introducing you, Anne-Marie Meisling. Welcome. Thank you. You are former head of sustainability in one of the world's most sustainable companies, at least in Denmark. Global head of corporate affairs at Kristian Hansen, and also at Novo Nordisk. you are the board of directors of the DIG's Committee for Sustainability, Advisory Board for the Center for Regenerative Management, you co-founders of Goral and in all ways one of the most knowledgeable people about sustainability. And we can cover a lot, Ann Marie. So the first thing I would like to ask you is that you have a little difficulty with the word sustainability. Can you try to elaborate on that? It's fun to have a hard time with a word that you have worked with all your life, especially in the last 20 years. So I think I'll start by saying that I always get happy when a company does something better. No matter how much better it is. When you reduce your CO2-impact, when you work with biodiversity, when you create more health and well-being in your own life or in the company, then I actually get really, really happy. So credit to all those who work with sustainability. When I see that there is a trend that I love that you are taking into account here in Supertrends, it is that we have a huge focus on sustainability at this time. We have the EU especially,. The EU is especially focusing on sustainability, so companies are now putting a lot of effort into sustainability. And the way we define it now is that we need to do less damage. We need to get rid of less, we need to release less CO2, we need to reduce the biodiversity than we do now. We need to make sure that our employees are less stressed. And that is all really sensible and good. Where I personally and where I also see a tendency to think more regeneratively, is to think more regeneratively. Can you say regenerative? No, you can't. There is a lack of a word, like sustainability, to think regeneratively. It's more a way of working with things than a goal. I would say it's a way of thinking and a way of doing things. And if I may ask, what do you see as the three most important parameters? Maybe a building approach to society. You could say a re-building approach to society. It's very important that we have some words for it, otherwise it won't work. And this re-establishing, which you yourself are taking into account, is really the core of the thinking. Because where sustainability is about doing less damage as quickly as possible, then this re-estab regenerative approach and thinking about, can we find solutions that actually make it better, that regenerate biodiversity, or that for example, take CO2 out of the air instead of just expelling less. So it's a different mindset in relation to the way we design processes and the way we design products. And it's good that you say that about designers, because it's not something you can necessarily do as one actor. It's also about seeing the whole system together and therefore being able to understand, I spent some time on these intelligent cities that have digital twins where everyone can sit and see a simulation and see where things go wrong and then actually see how they can create a better future together by changing the flow. So that's also a very important part of it. Maybe we just haven't had the technology for it before, or maybe we just haven't had the mindset, because everyone is doing their job as well as they can without looking up. I would say we haven't had the mindset, because the technology comes when you want to go somewhere. So it's more that a mindset has been that we have been more isolated from companies and we have looked at our challenges, our waste management and then we have tried to find solutions to that instead of thinking more systematically. And I would say if there are two things you really should try to think about within this regenerative thinking. One is to think about recreating, revitalizing and rebuilding. The other is to think in whole. You shouldn't think that you have to solve all the problems yourself. The cities are a great example. A house can be super innovative and maybe be what we call net positive. We'll get to that later. But the net positive thinking is, for example, that you absorb more CO2 than you emit. You can be energy positive, so you actually produce energy and give it back to the network. But the idea is that you can have single houses that are net positive. But where we want to go is to see cities that play together, so you have a whole city that actually works a bit like a forest. It's another metaphor that you can use and and that you use a lot in this thinking. We have the biological systems. Waste is not a problem in itself. No, almost the opposite. Should you be happy for the dog's poo-poo? It's a resource to that extent. So when the leaves, which are waste that falls down in the autumn, go down and become nutrition, and in that way they create the predisposition for life in the next season. Now we are talking about that, and your time on Kristians Hansen, I think it is important to look at the bacteria, for example. Because they can, just like you say, bacteria exist in advance, but you can work with them. Can you give some examples? Yes, and one of the reasons why Christian Hansen actually received this recognition as the world's most sustainable company is because I think they have been given an eye for what bacteria, can do in order to deliver solutions for the future. And if we start with the agricultural area... We have to, because the big pigs, pigs, deers, sheep and cows... So let's finally take some agriculture. Well, sheep and cities are two good examples to dig into to try and concretize what we are talking about. But if you think of microbiology as one of the really powerful bio solutions, as we call it, then Christian Hansen develops natural plant-based pesticides that help to replace pesticides. The way they work is actually regenerative. They are good bacteria that you use in the soil field on the ground and that are involved in strengthening the root network of the crops that they have developed so that the crops can, for example, absorb more nutrients and become more robust. And what we have seen with some of these plant protection products from Christian Hans Hansen's side, is that they actually work particularly well in some of the areas where there is more drought or where there is too much water. So this is really about thinking about climate change and how we can help the land use to become more resilient to climate change. Or I would almost say help nature to become more resilient to climate change. Yes, and if you take that, you can say learn from nature for how they actually do it. Because the idea of using bacteria is nature's own total superpower. And then you have company like Kristian Hansen and Novozymes, who really have the competence to find out how you use microbiology to accelerate the green environment in an incredible number of areas. And it's not only in agriculture, it's also about health. It's the same principle. Let's finally get into it. Not least because I've been sick for 14 days, coughed and coughed. So from taking medicine that takes it all the way by saying, can you use these bacteria to make a stronger body and a stronger health? I will send you some probiotics afterwards. But it is completely correct. You can say that in the same way as we talked about the microbiology that is used in the countryside to strengthen the root network so that it can really take up more nutrition. In the same way, Christian Hansen sells and develops what is called probiotics, which is used to strengthen your blood vessels and which makes your immune system stronger. And it has an incredibly many extra positive effects in relation to, entire cycle, your normal well-being, your stress level and all sorts of other things that you can get other experts to come in and talk about. But the point is actually... But it's the same point, it's regenerative. And that's what I want the listeners to catch. It's not just about minimizing damage here, it's actually about strengthening and building. And we need to have even more examples from you, Anne-Marie, because we were also in one of the very large climate lakes, and traditionally it has been seen as Nestlé, one of the biggest. And they are also working with something regenerative in the agriculture. Can you tell us a little bit about how they have... Yes, because if we look at trends, then one can say that it has always been one of the very large companies, which has also been involved in attracting the entire industry in one direction. And right now we see both Nestlé and Unilever, for example, have very ambitious programs to work with their suppliers, where they create incentives to work more regeneratively. And you like Nestlé, for example, in 2030, 50% of their core ingredients will all come from agriculture that works regeneratively. And that is something that we can see is creating a trend. Because, apart from Nestlé and Unilever do it, it also means that other industries are looking at what they are doing and starting to make some of the same policies and go that way. So they have, whether you know it or not, they have a four-tower role in the other world. Yes, they have at least a four-tone role. They just have a massive purchasing power and commitment. And they have an incredible commitment, because there are many who look at them. Where some of the smaller companies go a little more under the radar, then Unilever and Nestlé know that it is they who are first to be shot. And now we're talking about the EU coming up with with a greenwashing agreement. Because there has been a lot of greenwashing about us being the eco-dick and we are the eco-dad. And the consumer can't tell the difference between one or the other. Whether there has been a climate-release or whether there is a cut being stored, and if it is regenerative. So do you think this will work as an additional driving force for this direction? It's the next level. Right now there is a massive focus on creating increased transparency within sustainability. And the opposite of greenwashing is green hushing, where companies don't say anything. And the EU has now required that all companies should go out and communicate about how their influence is on the social and environmental area. This means that all companies in reality get out of the bush and are forced to say what their ambitions are and where they stand. So this in itself is really positive. It creates a lot of focus on it. And then you have these companies that are the leader of the thinking that then goes a step further. And if I try to dive a little into what it is like, and if I am regenerative. Yes, I think it's good to get some cases on. What is it, for example, they ask their farmers about? Well, it is, for example, that the work is very targeted with biodiversity, so that there should not be forestry. On the contrary, they have an ambition to plant 200 million trees before 2030, among the farmers they are from. That's one example. And they also work a lot with what is called the health of the earth. And that's exactly what we talked about before, where a company like Christian Hansen has a super good solution to work with micro-bacteria and health. And that's exactly one of the things they are focused on. And there they have some big programs with for example 500,000 of their countrymen, where they then go in and help them find more regenerative solutions. And that can be both working with biological plant protection in relation to pesticides, but it is also some of the techniques we have also known from the old days in relation to moving crops around and using the soil in a different way. I think it's interesting what you say, because it fits into a much wider picture of how the world economy is developing. I would say, I say normally from the beginning of the 80s, in what is called the precision economy, where you make things much more compact and precise. An example is gilding. Gilding is a potential source of pollution. In the old days, it was from guano, which is a bird's nest on some islands in the Stillehavet. It is a mechanical method to solve problems. Of course, it couldn't escalate that much. And then they started using the Harpo Bosch technology, where you then blow the chemical component of the fertilizer, which is the oxygen, from the air. It is really smart, but it costs about 1% of the world's energy consumption. But you can genetically modify plants, so they do it themselves. And then it's simply gone. The whole industry is in a way gone, because the plants do it themselves. So we go from something that is mechanical to something that is chemical, and then we go to something that is extremely precise and compact, and it can be microbiological, as you talked about with bacteria, it can be biochemical, under genetic manipulation, and then it can be, for example in nuclear power, nuclear physics. Would you call it organic? What did you say? Mechanical? The common denominator for microbiological, where you select or genomodify microorganisms, and biochemical and nuclearysical, is that it is extremely compact. We are completely down to atoms, atoms, it is not even molecules, we are down to atoms and subatomic particles, and we manipulate that, and then it becomes really, really elegant. And sometimes it becomes completely invisible, because it dissolves itself in reality. Yes, and I just want to say, we have, now we see this fusion between Novozymes and Christian Hansen in Denmark, I really think that within the biological or what is called biocellutions, we will have a stronghold that we should be proud of. You also had an example from Novo, was it Novo found it? Yes, it was an example of an interesting partnership, you will probably like it, Lars, now I look at you, which is a partnership between the Bill Gates Foundation and Novozymes, where they actually take CO2 and then they are able to use CO2 and produce it into vinegar. I'm I will not go into the details here, but that is the technology and the vinegar is used by Novozymes in their large fermenters to be able to produce alternative proteins. So the whole idea is that we have to have proteins in our diet and the idea is that you do not need to use, but you don't need sugar either. Which is the way we normally feed the big farmers, which requires a lot of land production, which can help reduce biodiversity. So it's a completely new, more technical way of producing, but with the use of biology as a superpower. I see why. That's what I fantasize about. Mankind has flown to Mars. Some people make a colony on Mars and then they use the Inovo technology to make CO2 in Mars to the burgers. But that's where we're basically at with this example. I think it's mind blowing. And if you have to be specific about one of their potentials, which I think is very funny, they say that if they take CO2-transmission from the cement industry in Egypt, then it can itself be enough to produce enough proteins for one billion people. And that would, for example, mean that because they don't need to use sugar in their production, but can use this vinegar that comes from CO2, then they avoid using a country that responds to Argentina. Wow. You almost have to say it again. That's the coolest thing I've ever heard. You say that CO2 from cement production in Egypt is enough to feed a billion people. Yes. So what we're out in is what we call that we use super abundant materials, in this case CO2, which we right now think we have a little too much of, to produce almost anything. And that's what's in the regenerative thinking. It is that we should not think of limitations. We should find those places where there is an abundance of resources, and then we should find out how we take that resource and produce it into something we need. Now I'm going to have you with me until 20.50. Biomimicry, or biomimetic in Danish, is design and systems inspired by nature to solve human problems, especially when it comes to sustainability. Here are three examples from real life. 1. Researchers in Japan have proven that you can use mushroom tracks in a petri dish to simulate the most optimal routes in the planning of a metro network. 2. The train from Namibia has an overfloor structure that has inspired researchers to develop materials that collect drinking water from the air in the desert areas. 3. The iconic Gherkin House in London has a facade that is directly inspired by a glass swamp at the bottom of the Stilleh the world market and the changes that are happening. And there are a lot of our listeners in companies who are now saying, well, against 2050, it sounds fantastic with that regenerative, that it's not just about minimizing damage here, but that we have to lift ourselves up to much higher levels and levels. How do we do that? How do you do that as a company? How do you do that mindset? How do you start the work processes? Because it's something we all have to be very careful about. I actually want to say that you might want to start with yourself. Now we start this podcast with doing some gymnastics, but there is something about making sure you have the energy to live your life so that you can give more than you take. I think that's a very good starting point. It applies to us as individuals, and it applies to the business leaders out there. But otherwise, how do you get started? Those who have gotten the most started have looked at an area that is core focus for them. So instead of taking something that is out in the periphery, look at the areas that are core focus for you. Some of the challenges you can see that will be within your industry, let's say in 2050 and then look at some fantastic partners. Because if the core was to work with re-building and re-creation, then we also have to do it in a system with others. And that's one of the essential things. So start with an interesting pilot project within an area that is your core area. Then find the right players that you can do it with. I think it's fantastic to get the protein out of CO2, but there is a long way to go. This investment is taken, you be taken proactively because they say, now we will be regenerative or is there any regulation that forces the companies out of it? Where is the hen and the egg? Why isn't anything happening before? Well, it happens, you could say, it goes that way. And there is also regulation to that extent that presses companies that way. As I said before, there is now EU regulation that means that everyone must go out and confess to the color. Also those who have not done it before in relation to their impact on the social and environmental area. It will mean a lot. So it's a way for regulation, without the regulation pointing to a specific technology, then they are just there to pressure companies to do something. And besides, we also see that there is a lot of investment going that way. Yes, that's what Lars was talking about. Suddenly you can't find the mines when you are going out to invest, even though you know that some of the minerals are to be used for energy storage. So how well does that investment case fit together? Well, there are two ways you can invest. So you have both, you can You have the dark green investments, in a positive way, understood as the Article 9 fund in the EU. Those who are looking for solutions in the future. And this impact fund is in a rapid development. So if you want to make an investment, it's easier to go that way. So Annemarie, if we also say that Money Talks is a good investment, and I have a bunch of money, and I want to have both return on investment and most possible impact, how does the regenerative fit in here? How do you get an eye on the best cases here? I would say right now, if you are going to attract funding, then you are in an incredible position if you have some products that are helping to solve some of the problems of the future within biodiversity or climate. There is a lot of money and there will be even more in 2050. You can say that the money is distributed in different ways. You have some funds, such as the Impact Fund, which goes directly into finding future technologies, which you want to have. You can measure impact so you can report on it. And that's super interesting for because of what we talked about before. Then you have the more traditional fund, which really just wants to avoid risk. And which looks at, are there industries that are so fossil dependent, that we don't dare to have them in our portfolio? Well, they are then phased out in the same way as tobacco and alcohol. So there are two different ways to think about it. And on top of that, if you are going to refinance your loan or if you want to have obligation financing in one way or another, there are new, much more favorable conditions if you can prove that you have control over your environmental impact, you are not negatively affected by climate challenges, you have taken into account it, but even better if you can show that you have some technologies where you can actually drive this wave in the future. And then it's about walk the walk, that it should be a red red thread all the way through. That means that if you sit and work with regenerative and move from CO2 to proxies, for example, then it shouldn't be that you have employees who are stressed and falling over. It should be a mindset throughout the organization where you think that we should have more insight into everyone. I think it's incredibly fascinating that you imagine some employees who are in human growth, who are growing and getting more energy from being in the labour market, than the opposite. Is it utopia? I'm thinking almost already now, how can you think otherwise? How can you you have a workplace where you aim to reduce stress? When you work with people, you have to think about how to do the best for the people close to you. But how do you do it in practice? We see that stress and burnout is one of the biggest public diseases globally at the moment. And maybe because we are our own worst boss, so we are driving on a suicidal journey. I think that the thinking of the past saw people as machines. And in reality, that is also the paradigm shift I'm trying to talk into without using that terminology. In the industrialization of the past, people were a resource that you could put into a box and you could determine how much they should work, when they should work, how they should do it, how they should sit. In the future, and the future has already come, especially after Corona, we recognize that we are biological beings. And biological beings have a brain that sometimes needs to relax. We need to be super aware of our sleep. We need to be super aware of how we eat. We need to be super aware of our motion. And we need to be super aware of how we eat, we need to be super aware of our motion and we need to be super aware of how the brain has the best conditions. How, against 2050 Anne-Marie, do we ensure that the regenerative part is measured, seen, quantified, so it exists? How do we measure biodiversity? How do we measure the positive impact of nature? It's easier in the environmental area than it is in the social area. In relation to the environment, it is about measuring, as we are already doing now, how we are positively involved in the production of CO2. There is still a long way to go, but that is the way we measure it. How do we measure biodiversity? We are actually right now starting to find out how we measure biodiversity at all. We have had a huge focus on climate and we have become good at it now and we have been given standardized methods to measure it, which is super good. Now it comes to biodiversity, so we are sure we can measure it in the right way. And here you also have some technology that is essential in terms of helping to measure biodiversity on the market, so that it is not something that people have to count, but you have the technology to help you. Yes, you can see for example in the forest, you can swipe the leaves and then you find pieces of DNA from all kinds of species. You do it in a jungle and then you find on the leaves DNA from fish and then you sit and nod your head. It turns out that there are some birds there, who catch some fish in a river and then when they make poo-poo, then some DNA powder comes flying around and settles on the sheets. So it's called eDNA, environmental DNA. Then you put some microphones on, it's Internet of Things. They listen to the sound, and then the combination of these two things gives you a relatively good summary of what's going on in this forest. And that's where we need AI to accelerate this setup, and there's a huge potential for that. So, a pattern recognition with you, that within agriculture, construction, cities, they think more in systems, use nature's own resources. If you look out towards 2050, where is it that we really broke the knot? If you can get one dream fulfilled in relation to all this with the regenerative and we manage to think, think that it was so difficult for us to fix it, but now we did it. What was it then? Was it that we could measure it or was it the mindset? Where is it that we are moving with this big step now? I think my dream is actually... Lars started by saying that when we were most sustainable, in reality we were most sustainable before we started with this industrialization and really destroyed a lot of what actually worked. So I would say, one dream is actually that we put nature in the center of the way we measure things and say that it is also an interest that really should be a participant in the decisions. It may sound a bit, you can say, out there. Not at all, there are some rivers and all kinds of other of things that are starting to get natural rights. But the truth is that we are incredibly dependent on nature. So it's not something that's outside of us. We are in principle nature and we are incredibly dependent on it. So it can be one way to think about it. So from nature you have come, to nature you will be. Thank you very much for being here. It was a pleasure. What is a sustainable future in 2050 really? And how does a world that works for everyone look like? If that's something you're looking for answers to, then take a look at SOLARPUNK. Where cyberpunk is about spiritual destruction, ecological collapse and unreliable technology, SOLARPUNK is about smart citizenship in front of smart cities, about education in front of demoralization and about the regener regenerative, beyond the revolutionary. Of the many great challenges ahead of us, the solarpunk genre takes hold of one of the simplest. That we generally have far more language for everything that doesn't work and what we want to get away from, than what actually works and where we want to go. Well Lars, what about sustainability? The way I see it, again with the helicopter view, it's true, as Anne-Marie said, that we were actually the most sustainable in the Stone Age, but it wasn't so nice to have a average life age of 18 years and be murdered and such. For every woman. Yes. But there is something called, in English, the environmental Kuznets curve. And it's built the economy that at first it gets worse and then it gets better. And it gets better when you get richer. And that means on Environmental Performance Index, which is an assessment of how clean different countries are, apart from a whole lot of different criteria, it's the cleanest country in the world, world. And now I know everything. Surprise! That's because Lars lives there. Yes, that's because I live there, but it's not. It's because they are rich. And the most polluting, unprofitable countries are the poorest. But Lars, it's because they send what pollutes to the poorer countries. It's not because they don't get the uranium, it's just because they don't leave it in Switzerland, but they externalize the costs to the rich. Yes, you have to consider that when you do such an assignment, but it's true if you say that we're straining the demands so much, for example in Denmark, that the production has moved to China and then they just use coal-fired plants and run waste water directly out into the rivers. That's why I think it's interesting if we, as a part of this, say, can we take some of these things home? The examples Anne-Marie came up with, that's actually something we have in Denmark, how much can be left in Switzerland in relation to taking the production home and taking responsibility for it to happen in a regenerative way. Yes, and I think we do more for the world. Instead of throwing out production, because then you can't see it in the cleanliness regulationsregulation for a country. If we turn up the cleanliness, gradually we are not so fast and so hard that we simply push the problem over to others. It will probably be where you get the biggest effect, because then you will solve it with technology. And that's what I would like to say about this. Because I mentioned that the precision economy started in the early 1980s, and it is based on IT and biotechnology. It has gradually become more and more advanced and it is getting better. But it seems like a phase change is happening because we are on the way to the hyper-intelligent economy right now. It started seriously with AI's breakthrough last year. And we can see now, for example in material technology, how they have put artificial intelligence on finding new materials or finding new possible crystals and different other things. So you develop such a model and then you start to dig through all the different atoms and molecules and so on. And then it comes with millions, in some cases, of different answers. In two weeks! One of these models did it all in 17 days. That means that you discover more than 1000 times as many permutations as you knew in the past, that you would have spent years to find out in two weeks. And it just started, and then quantum computers come along that can solve some calculations that... And if you look at it as an investor, then there is also a market for buying it and taking it and doing something other than what you usually do. Yes, there has never been a better time in the history of the world to make start-up companies than now. But that means that this is starting to break through in the concrete physical world around us, including the environment, within the next 10-15 years. I think we will experience a special, I would say second half of this century, an extremely rapid improvement in sustainability and the environment in the world because of these technologies. That's good, because in the beginning, when you said that everyone had to go through the same development, then there are long views. Yes, but they run, in Africa they run steam engines and coal-fired plants for a years and they can use some smarter technologies. So it brings me to something we have talked about in previous episodes. But in terms of sustainability there is an economist who has made a distinction between what he calls light, bright and dark environmentalism. So light is what Anne Marie actually mentioned, that you should start by looking at yourself and you live cleanly and he says it's good, but it's not good enough. And that's because they are completely equal. People who don't have, 20% of Russians don't even have a toilet at home, they go out to Siberia, in Africa they live in deep wilderness, many of them, etc. They are completely happy with it. So it won't solve the problems as a whole, but it helps of course. And then there is dark environmentalism, and you poked me a little earlier in the broadcast with, if we now have lots of almost free and clean energy, we will not drive a lot of energy we should not use. And the answer to that from his side and from my side is that if we become rich, we become cleaner. That's what the Global Environmental Performance Index shows us very clearly. So we are on the way to using extremely advanced, extremely compact technologies that use super-advanced raw materials to create a clean world. And we also have technologies to recreate extinct, destroyed ecosystems. So if we take regenerative access, is it nice or neat? Is it something that society can live without? You say you can do that in Russia. Yes, you can in the meantime Middle Ages, but the world can't be as clean as the catastrophic scenario in the movie Wall-E, which I recommend to everyone. So it's need to have. Yes, it's need to have. Slowly or fast? I've been listening to this for 20 years now. I am looking forward to seeing the curve you are talking about. When I say the curve is breaking up, it is the curve of research that is breaking up right now. And in the real world we will see the consequences of this for the next 15 years massively. So we are happy with the hyper-intelligence wave that is coming. Hard or hard to invest in? I would say there are some terrible greenwashing scandals out there and some of it comes from paying off your shit instead of maybe taking ownership of what needs to be done at home and thus you don't know if it will succeed or not to make the world a better place. It's easier to invest in, but you have to think about it. For example, while windmills manufacturers have recently lost a lot of money,, you have to think about the metal that goes into the windmills instead, because that's what you have to invest in. And it's a bit like in the old days, where they who made the most money on the gold mines were the ones who sold the gold. So you have to have a realistic analysis of the entire commercial ecosystem to understand who is the weak point here. It is typically those who will earn the most, because they lack what they do. And then we usually say rich, sustainable or clever, but it should be rich, regenerative or smart. Yes, but it gets a full screw on everything. You can call it whatever you want.

We blame people seriously, I think that's the least we can do. So we can't help them with welfare in any way, but we can help them with things they find exciting. And I think they would be much more ethical than we are. One thing can be two things at the same time. The reality is more complex than we want it to be. This is Supertrends. The show where we investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyng-scape and mysterious materials have been found that do not contain the earth's Welcome to a program where we will talk about, yes, Kjart Barn has many names and now it is called UAP, Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena. I look forward to hearing our three guests tell us how our reality is turned upside down if the alien beings come. During the hearing, a Jäger pilot, Ryan Graves, was asked why he thought it was important that there were better in-reporting opportunities for commercial pilots. And his answer was that UFOs are a much greater risk for commercial passenger flights than anyone else. Because 95% of all these sightings, people who get an eye on UFOs, are simply not in-report reported because of stigma. It's so embarrassing that you think, I just didn't see this. Lars, do you think it's stigma, that it's embarrassing to say that you have seen a UFO that keeps a well of observations back, which we should have been reported? As a starting point, I I have most of my life assumed that they were flying to Lærken, and it was free-spies or something like that. But I sit with the listening flaps out. I'm ready to listen to someone who says something else. I think in any case, that everything that people observe, they should be informed so that we can find out if something is happening that we don't really know what it is. That's the attitude we humans should have. There are many things that we have found, so just because we can't see them with the naked eye, it doesn't mean that they are not there. We have made a lot of programs, Lars, and I have to remind the listeners, we are going up to these 50,000 listeners. If to continue with Supertrends after 24.7 closes, then remember to share and like and so on. But we have, among other things, talked about a completely new intelligent life form on earth, which is actually AI. If we get a form of hyper intelligence, then it is a new beast we have invited. Yes, that's right. It's funny because we have talked about for so long about how we will behave when we meet an intelligence or super intelligence from the outside. And And then suddenly it goes up for us. It's not what's going to happen first. What happens first happens in the next few years. We have created one ourselves and then we have to adapt to it. I'm looking forward to hearing what our guests are talking about. But first we have to get out of your timeline. Super Trans Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built by world-leading experts. In combination with artificial intelligence, it gives a clue to when future groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. This timeline I have today goes up to 2250 2250. So we are really looking far. But we start in 2025, and that is when the American Energy Ministry will support development. They do not have a concrete plan to give economic support to the development of nuclear and thermonuclear rocket engines. That is to say, instead of having a chemical process to run a rocket engine, you have a nuclear process. And that can give some advantages in terms of that there is much more power, that they can both fly longer and they weigh less if you do that. In 2027, the European raw material industry will be able to demonstrate one that works. In 2029, you will for the first time see a rocket being sent from another planet. In 2030, you will test to produce protein on another planet. This can be done chemically by extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In 2032, we will have a concrete solution to this. If an asteroid comes that is dangerous for the planet, how can we send a rocket out and then with an atomic bomb make it change course so that we save the planet. Then there will be people landing on Mars' largest moon, and that is in 2033. In 2035 we will start making three robots that are out in space on Mars or somewhere else, which with the help of the material there begins to 3D print infrastructure, that is to say to prepare both manned and unmanned civilizations there. When I say unmanned civilizations, then of course it is In 2035, with the combination of artificial intelligence and robot technology, we want to have autonomous mine workers and robots, for example on the Moon or Mars. I have always believed that it would make sense to have mine driven out into space and then throw things back home. Lars, if you live on Mars, are you then a room man or a room lady? I'm thinking about it. Oh, now we have to watch out because there are many sexes, you know that well. Oh sorry, you were too kind to talk to me. We'll handle that. So in 2035, there is a expectation that we will have a permanent human presence in the orbit around the moon. And that in 2035, the US will send a nuclear thermonuclear rocket to Mars. And then in 2037, we run into something completely different, namely where a lot of artificial intelligence is developing, because there will be an AI that says it is self-confident. And that's something we can look back to, because a lot of this will be destroyed in the future. Then nuclear infrastructure will be established, that is nuclear power plants on Mars in 2037. And in 2038 a moon base will be made the Moon, where people can live. And in 2040, a permanently manned base on Mars. So there is a prognosis, it is a completely crazy prognosis, it is a pure guess. It is that in the last 2065 we have found that there is life outside the universe. And that is by analyzing the atmosphere on a planet and saying that this atmosphere can only be explained by the fact that there is life on that planet. In 2070 we have lunar tourism, in 2080 we have route rockets between Mars and the moon, in 2080 we also have an interplanetary internet, which means we have routers that fly around the universe and reinforce the signals so that you have communication in a very large area out there. And then in 2100 the first room elevator is made. It's that It is a cord that goes up from a rotating object such as the moon or the globe. From the end of the cord there is a room station and then you can drive an elevator up and down the cord. It is the rotation force that keeps the cord in place. My guess is that it will not be made from the globe, because it is of course the rotation force that keeps the string tense. My guess is that it is not made from the globe because it is too dangerous, but that it is made on the moon instead. In 2100 there is a coherent concept plan for how to create what is called the terraforming of Mars so that it becomes habitable. And in the year 2110, we have machines that can colonize other planets, that is, we send a rocket to a place that has machines, it is artificial intelligence and robots, and they are able to establish themselves on another planet and make copies of themselves and thus create an artificial technology that in reality builds a civilization on another technology. And in 2021 they will also be able to seed another planet with new life forms, that is to say they analyze atmosphere, temperature and so on, and then say we can make some cells here that can survive here and then they start life. Then there will be space ports instead of airports. The first on Mars will be established in 2125, which is a highly trafficked space port. In 2130 there will be Mars tourism. And then there will be a little psychedelic one. In 2091 we genetically developed another animal species on Earth to become so intelligent that it can create a civilization. And then in 2050 we start to make planet seeding, and that is presumably the terraforming of Mars. But you have to guess here. So a project is underway to make Mars a habitable planet. Lars, right now, just from a good feeling, do you believe in UFOs? Yes or no? Because I'll test you again when we've heard our three guesses. My own best guess is that there are no UFOs on the globe, but there are UFOs on other globes than ours. Because there are so many globes, so statistically there must be some places where this happens. When talking about incredible things in the earth's airspace, it is important to remember that we as people of the law are very rarely invited to the latest radical innovation from the military, intelligence services and the private defense industry. An example is the legendary and top secret spy plane SR-71 Blackbird from Lockheed Martin. It flew around 26 km with three times the speed of sound. At a time when most had black and white television and the few had put their feet in a passenger plane. Blackbird was totally secretive from 1964 and almost 30 years on. And is therefore a reminder that whatever we see in the sky can be created by humans, even if we don't understand it. I'm looking forward to welcoming you UFO experts, or whatever you want should call it now or at least professionally. One of them is Jacob Bok Axelsen. You are CTO at Deloitte Denmark with special interest in quantum and AI. You are a physicist and earlier researcher at the Center for Astrobiology in Madrid. Welcome! Thank you. Then I have you, Anja Andersen. You are known for this, because you have been a podcast on flying talerks in advance. But you are also a professor of astrophysics at the Niels Bohr Institute. I know you follow every development within this area. Last but not least, Dennis, you are known here in the program because you are the one who makes our facts and facts lectures. You are a presenter and mediator of the progress of humanity. You have the newsletter that I will be presenting now, called Actual News, which is incredibly good, which will be out every Friday. You are also working at ThirdEar. And then you are so curious about UFOs. And right since we started recording Supertrend, you were like, hey, Lise Lotte and Lars, can we make a show about UFOs? Please, please, please, please. It's not a real Supertrend. But if it happens, it will turn our whole lives upside down. And Supertrends is about technologies turning our world upside down. What about UFOs,, Dennis? Well, that's what UFOs are. Bottom line, that's what they are. If there is the slightest chance that this will end up in a deadlock, then it is so incredibly important that we start learning to get a sense of it, that we start calculating the stigma around the subject and can start relating to it, what if? And that's one of the main points, that if this ends up being a problem, then the entire Lars timeline will implode. Because that timeline is based on that we don't have access to technologies that are as radically advanced as they possibly are, if we end up finding out that these reverse engineering programs and so on have actually found their place, are finding their place, and we get access to radically new energy sources, not least. Anja, how long has this UFO hunt been going on, and how much have people seen and have it reflected the culture and time they were in at that time? Well, it depends on how you look at it, because in a way there has been something for many thousands of years, as long as we have written in written language, where people have had some experiences they have not been able to explain, as they have put words on. Then they may have called it angels, or talked to God, or talked about something they couldn't explain. And the whole modern UFO myth started back in the Second World War, with Ros incident, where something fell down. The authorities said that a flying saucer landed somewhere else, which we are now in possession of. Afterwards they said that it never happened, and that we didn't mean it, and that it has nothing to do with it. So what's a little mysterious is that there's something flying around in the airspace that people can't figure out what it is. There are people who have some unclear experiences and then there are the public authorities who don't want to talk about it, and who all the time say, that it has nothing to do with it, and we don't know anything about it, and at the same time really show off. So you can say that there are many things that play into thinking, what is going on? You are Jacob Husteløyt, talk about UFOs in the breakfast break. But the fact that it is called UAPs, makes it more clear that the congress has been talking about it. Then there is war in Europe. There are a lot of things happening. If this started with the onset of the Cold War, then we are well on the way to a new form of tension. There are a lot of secrets in the defense or elsewhere. Something we are not clear about. There must be secret in the defence. It has to be a security reason, of course. If there is a secret about UFOs, I can only guess. I don't think there are a lot of secrets about UFOs in the defence, but there are reports now and things are coming out. And I would say, if there is a stigma, then it should be removed. Of course, you have to report everything you see, and I don't think anyone should be worried about, an air captain shouldn't be afraid of being fired if he comes back and says, I think I saw a UFO. It sounded a bit like you said, inexplicable experiences. So if you see an inexplicable unclear experience, you can come back and tell about it. But we talk about everything in the breakfast break in Deloitte, and we also talk about UFOs, and we talk about early universes and everything else. At least those around me, by my table. So you think that the talk about UFOs can be more stu-clean? Have you experienced a change in that? Stu-clean and stu-clean. There is no cancelled culture if you say you believe in a UFO. You know what, I could imagine, but now I know some of the senior leaders from Deloitte, I could imagine that if I came and said I've seen a UFO, now we're going to have it on our... No, they're cute and weird, so you shouldn't be afraid of that. You just come and tell them about UFOs, that's fine. Otherwise you just say, I've just said it's okay. But it's one of the important points right now, because there is a change in mentality that's been going on since about 2017, where there were these articles in the New York Times that made it more and more messy. In 2020, Pentagon came on the scene, validated some videos, and Pentagon said, hey, this is literally a UFO, we don't know what it is, you can choose to believe in Pentagon or or not, but there is a movement where it becomes more and more okay to talk about it. And that's why now the time is up. Now we have to talk about it. It's also because you have some measurements. And you have data, you have all kinds of things. Some people think they have seen something. You can always put question marks. There are some who Some people have seen something, and some people have measured something. So the way forward is to systematize these measurements. And that's what I don't understand. We all walk around with a smartphone. Dennis, what is the most convincing argument that there are UFOs out there? Well, quite frankly, it's this. What happened in the second half of 2023 in the American Congress, the way this topic was discussed after David Grush stood out, in June 2023 there was a hearing with three witnesses under oath, on July 26, 2023, where they under oath told about all their... what they now even know. And in the congress they treat it with the most serious respect. Because it's about a lot of money for these supposed reverse engineering programs, Black, whatever programs that exist in the Pentagon, whatever it could be. There are all kinds of aspects to this, and they frame it all the time with the American population having the right to know this, and then on the other hand, it's like, okay, humanity has the right to know this as well. But the way you talk about it, it should be enough to legitimize this subject. There are no one who has seen a UFO land on their Easter lunch yet. So not something convincing? Was it you Anja who told me about a lot of children who had drawn a UFO in the same way. Yes, there was a school in Africa. It triggers me a little, because I simply do not believe that you can get so many children to live at the same time. Can you tell me about that, Anja? Yes, it's a documentary about a school in Zimbabwe, I think it is, where there were about 100 children, who in a free quarter saw a UFO land and a creature came out of the UFO and who at the teleportation gave them a thought that they should simply be part of saving the planet, that is to say, to ensure sustainability and climate. And what was it, the teachers sat down to, what teachers went to a teacher meeting or something like that at the teacher's office. So not many of them saw it, they say. But later they said they might have, but they didn't dare to speak out at the time. And then a psychologist from Harvard came down and interviewed the children a very short time afterwards, before they actually had they had time to talk to each other about what they had seen and got them to draw drawings of it. And then I think, it's hard to imagine a collective lie. And they were small children. And now they are grown up and it has traumatized them some of them all their lives. Traumatized them? Couldn't they save the world? Yes, but it has felt like a shell on their shoulders and what has traumatized them was that they got to know that it was just something they had found. So the treatment, what can you say, it's the people around them who have said you you haven't had that experience. And that can traumatize people. What do you say, Janka? I think, Anja, you're hitting the head on the head by talking about data. Because that's the only thing we have to go after. And it can be incredibly difficult to understand what's going on, even when you have data. And it must be there that we always go back. The right measurements that you can rely on a lot. Otherwise we have nothing, unfortunately. I can tell you that the LIGO experiment that measures gravity waves, which Anja undoubtedly understands much better than me. But there it was actually, when you lit it the last time here, a few years after having calibrated and worked on it for 40 years in a row, then you measure with the same weight wave that comes from two black holes that collide and fuse. And you just didn't believe it. The people who had made the detector didn't believe it. They ended up eliminating all forms of errors. And in the end they stood in a room and looked at each other and said, it's you who has faked it, have you faked it? And they all said no, then there is only one conclusion. It is so difficult to understand what is happening in the room. It's not easy. And with smartphones, you can fake everything. All data can be fake, even if it comes from smartphones, from people, video and all sorts of things. It's very difficult to rely on these types of information. So we need to have some verifiable measurements before we can move on. And that's probably where it's best. Dennis, have there been any other material characteristics that you are used to? Yes, all this subject is surrounded by various technologies and physical phenomena that are happening again. None of it is validated. You can find all kinds of things in rabbit holes on Reddit, in different places. And in mainstream media, there are things that are happening again. And that's how I am re-enact my world picture. All information has zero value for me, even if I find it in the New York Times or on 4chan or some other weird place. But when I find it, when it starts to go back to different places, I get some information to a candidate for truth. And then I've made a list of what technologies are going back. And that's one only half plausible reason I have fallen over. Because that is the argument with all smartphones, why doesn't everyone record a video of a UFO or it always looks like a pixelated one. The only interesting reason I have found an argument is that these wonderful crafts have it with simply to bend the light around around, because it's so much about energy in all sorts of ways, and gravity and anti-gravity, that when you turn your camera towards it, it's like when you have a flimsy shirt on a TV camera, it ruins the picture. And are there others, Because there is also something with heat measurements. Anja, isn't there something with not being able to measure their normal... Yes, you haven't measured any exhaust gas, you could say. Which otherwise is how we think things move when we build them. But as Lars said very nicely at the beginning, technology is a development. There are big reports from Copenhagen about what to do in 120 years when there are even more horses with horses in the city. And it will never become relevant. I would like to hear from just to give the listeners a glimpse of how these UFOs look. They look like flying talarcks. At first glance, they look like goblins, watermen flying around. Yes, that was the last one. It looked like a silver balloon or something. But otherwise, it's something that looks like a flying saucer or a triangle. Something with three lights that fly together. It can be hard to tell if it's a collected object or a formation flight of three things. Is that what they saw in Greenland? Yes, they saw light. And it's light you don't see at night, it's full daylight. I think that's interesting, Jacob, now that you want to have physical anomalies. Yes, I'll just say one thing, in terms of information that comes up around. There was an interesting study where they analyzed 125.000 memes from the beginning of Twitter to now. And there is a very convincing conclusion that the fake things spread faster. And you have to keep an eye on that, because it's good that it's coming up in many places. In fact, you can predict how popular a thing will be by looking at how it spreads on Twitter. But the content of the truth is unfortunately something that has to go through a very strict review, and then there will be some who ask extremely many irritating questions. And that's what Anja and I have experienced throughout our career. It's really, really irritating to send a manuscript and then formulate it and some don't believe it because there's something wrong. And it's not a perfect method, but that's where we probably should go. I was thinking about telling you how we saw it at the Center for Astrobiology in Madrid. That could be very interesting. So the thing is that... It's not a crime novel, but the hypothesis is that there is at least one cell life, probably spread throughout the universe. Because there are many barriers to how you could imagine a civilization. One of the biggest barriers is that you can see on Earth that one cell life has passed to multiple cells and it took two billion years. It's very difficult to communicate. Think about the Twitter story before and think about two cells that have to find out how to find each other. They have to more than just date, they need to make organs and do a lot of other things. And it was really, really difficult to do that. It's a pretty big barrier. So that's one thing. Another thing is that we have observations outside the room, and Anja is of course also familiar with them, but we have looked out at stargates. And there you can that there are more than just ordinary raw materials in their singular form, but there are actually also molecules, organic molecules. There is something called polyamide hydrocarbon, which is a relatively complex molecule that swirls around out there. And when they swirl around out there, they don't hit anything. They have to hit something to be able to be tamed. What is it that has created them? That is a big question. You can imagine a lot of things, but it is organic molecules that are in the family with the organic molecules we are made of. There are some slightly more difficult observations about whether you have seen amino acids in these stars. And that is what our proteins are made of. And if we have amino acids or nucleic acids, we are well on the way to making the biopolymers that control our lives, which occur in water. There are many things that indicate that life could have been created on Earth. But there is a little controversy at the moment, that if you look at the tree of life, and you look at the genome that our very last common ancestor has, the last universal common ancestor, LUCA. There are some researchers who claim that they find a LUCA once in a while on Earth, and that it was found in Norway, etc. But Luca has a slightly too complex genome. Luca knows too much. Luca doesn't appear like a human or a little girl, or completely helpless. Luca knows a lot of things. Luca can survive in space, and be able to resist to zero degrees, and has a lot of things, like survive in a room and resist 0 degrees and has a lot of other abilities that are a bit... spooky. So all of our civilization comes from a room being, that's what you're telling me? It could be, because if you want to solve this problem, if Luca is too complex, then Luca must have come from another place. It could also be that Luca has risen because the earth has been weird to be on, then a huge meteor comes in, which swallows us all out in the field around the sun, and then the earth seems to be dirty and dirty, so we just keep on fertilizing ourselves all the time, and you can say that it is very romantic, but then the UFO story comes from there. But should it be that the time it takes to make a complex genome, and you look at how it has gone since then, then we have many billions of years before the earth rose and the sun was formed. And that's a problem, because the earth has not been there. But then there is theory I just revealed, called the Goldilocks Universe. The Earth is located in the Goldilocks Zone. The Earth is a stone planet, we have our inner heat, an atmosphere and a magnetic field that protects us. But there are a lot of factors that are quite unique for us, so we have our special super VIP lounge here. But it's small. And even though there are billions and endless many planets out there, the question is a bit about, we look at two things that are fighting each other. The size of the room versus the likelihood that these golden zones lie under the planets. So biological life as we know it, could have been there. It could be that the theory is completely wrong. When I heard it, I was very happy because it answers the question of whether life has been frozen down in the 9 billion years that went from then to the fact that there are some golden age and then life can fight for billions of years to become more cells on earth. The last thing about the universe is that the whole idea that there is possibly a single cell life in the universe is the work hypothesis. What do you think of that Anja? Is that something you have heard before? Yes, I think we are many who will be surprised if there is no life elsewhere in the universe. It would actually be more amazing to be in a universe where we are the only living organisms, than to be in a universe where there is life almost everywhere. We have found many planets around other stars, we have found many that are in what we call the golden lock zone, where there is a place for liquid water. And we have plans to investigate them. Lars said that we should go to 2035, before we look at the atmosphere of an exoplanet. He was a bit pessimistic, because it will happen before. because it's actually on the carpet with the James Webb Space Telescope. So we're actually starting with the problem with life. What do you say to that, Lars? You can comment on that. I think it's important to find indications of life, but I agree. Yes, we're starting with that. I think you're a bit too pessimistic about the fact that we are trying to fertilize other planets. Because soon Elon Musk and the other rich men will come in, thinking that they will die soon. And then they will be desperate and they have money. So I think they will build thousands of small satellites that they send out in the room with some sperm samples, just hoping that they hit something. And then we're actually already on the move. So it's not sure it will hit anything, but it's a place to start. It would surprise me a lot. It's just a little bottle post. Does it do that at some point? Yes. May I ask a question to that bottle post? Because they can they can also send something more advanced, namely a flexible life incubator that lands on a planet and then analyzes the circumstances there and then develops a life that is tuned to thrive on that planet. Yes, so it takes a little longer, I think. The technology is not quite there yet, but it is on some level. And then you run into a paradox we have, a Fermi paradox, which is that if life can replicate itself through artificial intelligence and robots and such, why haven't we met them yet? We should hear that. Why haven't we met them yet? And that's what we need to hear. Why haven't we met them? If they can replicate life in the room, as Anja says, why haven't we met more of them? Is it because they have a form we don't see or can see? I think that's interesting. It can quickly become very long-haired can also be too short-lived. The point is that people are extremely skeptical and refuse to believe it. What proof should they present it as? The mid-zone is where people are professional. They're curious,. We know the laws of physics, we know evolution theory, etc. It is the limit to impossible. And where I like to dabble sometimes, is when you recognize that the latest Nobel Prize in physics went to physicists who proved that quantum mechanics is a mega real thing and can be found in different scales. Which means that one thing can be two things at the same time. The reality is more wonderful and complex than we want it to be. Now I'm going to have a long way out in the future. When you talk about incredible things in the earth's airspace, it is important to remember that we as law enforcement people are very rarely introduced to the latest radical innovation from the world's military, intelligence services and private defense industry. An example is the legendary and top-secret spy plane SR-71 Blackbird from Lockheed Martin. It flew around 26 km with three times the speed of sound at a time when most had black and white vision and the few had put their feet in a passenger plane. The question is whether we get new terms of time, for example with the word quantum, whether we get new terms of placement, whether there are people out there who are willing to help us. Isn't there something about the fact that there has been extra UFO-reactions about atomic bomb-making sites? Especially where people have made some nuclear things. Have they been observed? Or was it you who told them? Yes, there are several sightings in relation to that. And again, the children, it indicates that there is some intelligence out there, that wants to tell us something, and when they don't want to tell us anything, they are just stupid. Because the question is whether there are extra sightings there, because there is extra activity there. Some people think that's because they want to study our understanding of nuclear theory. But it could also be that there are just extra signs there, because that's where you have a higher level of security. So we have the measuring instruments that actually register them. It could actually be that it happens all the way, but there are just not, you know, anyone to measure it. Because that's one of the problems with this. And what's interesting about what's happening now is that the military has started to give something of what they measure. They suddenly get a new radar. Then they see things they haven't seen before. And the question is, do they see it because it first came now or is it just because their old radar was like a shot and it was set up like this? Because all instruments are set up to measure what you think you should find. It's a bit like being on a dark road and then only looking under the street lights, even if you think the most exciting is out in the woods. I dropped lost my nails in a dark cave, but I'm still under the light. Exactly. That's why it would be interesting to talk about it and start talking about it. Can we make some measuring instruments? And the problem is that it's the military that has the measurements and there are some military secrets that they don't want to share. But if you could put some civil instruments up with something they could share, that doesn't show military secrets, then it starts to look like a research experiment. And we can see that it's it is no longer the military that is first movers. It is the big tech giants, Jacob. So what do you think will happen to the breakthrough in the field of surveillance and all the other things that might give us better forces to gather up? If someone introduces a UFO, they will come in handy. I think it will be difficult to handle. It would be a very wild change. I think it would be very difficult to handle if it happens that way. I don't think it will happen if it does. But Anja, aren't there aliens that are captured somewhere? I don't know, some say so. A living being that is lying there? Is that the case? David Grosham, the whistleblower and intelligence officer with a lot of experience in the highest level of the American defense, is one of his postulates. He says that the government is in possession of 12-15 intact and partially intact crafts of non-human origin and not least biological remains, in some cases more alive than others, that is to say pilots from some of these things. And that's where he stops. It could be fun to speculate a little bit on what UfoTech could actually be. What could they actually have had? If we haven't seen anything of them out there. We start by making a lot of dust on the earth. We are very loose. It's pretty crazy what we are doing. Now we have to clean up and think about it. All the dust we have made will be visible. But in fact, life has been visible for a long time. Observe the atmosphere. If you see fire in an atmosphere, will be made of something. Because fire will react with a lot. So if you measure an atmosphere and see it is not stable, then there is something. You like to get us out in 2050. What happens? What can we do? What interesting about this, if you combine it with Lars' timeline, is that if you find out that these technologies are real and we suddenly get possession of them, then you make all forms of progress that we are familiar with, that have this thermic and chemical way of coming completely over-fluid. All rocket technology we know becomes over-fluid, because suddenly you are able to produce, for example, what is called gravitational propulsion, where you don't push yourself forward, but you are sucked into something. It's a technology that really goes a long way in this. We have laser technology, all kinds of different species of laser technology that makes us able to extract raw materials from, for example, mountain sides. That's why you always give children a laser sword when they need some space. Yes, yes, wait for it. So in general, we talk a lot about what is called non-Newtonian physics. It's a new era of physics that we have to navigate around. And it's a lot about energy. Fusion energy is something we ourselves experiment a lot with and research in. Zero point energy. What is it? Where you drop into the constant... Vacuum energy? Yes, where you are constantly moving. No, that would be the forward movement. Either you are moving with the vacuum or you have something heavy in front of you. And then you are attracted to what is being brought with you. So if you can move it forward, it is a great way to travel through time and space. Superleaders at room temperature, that's something we humans are researching a lot about, that would be a huge breakthrough. All kinds of different quantum technologies. Can you explain superleaders at room temperature, Anja? Yes, it's like if there's a current in a pipe, there's some resistance, that is, we lose electricity in the pipe as heat. And that's actually quite a lot we lose. And super pipe means that you have a material that can transport the electrons without loss. And that means that if you can make a super pipe, then you actually start to have solved the earth of the earth. Because then you can preserve energy from windmills and solar panels without losing it. So it's a really hot topic. But Jacob, can't we also assume that they have control over it? Yes, we almost have control over it. With quantum computers, it's something we will have control over. That's the cool thing about quantum computers. They can solve some problems quite effectively. Some of them have to do with material and chemical properties. So we can calculate how the next vaccine will look like when it blocks an overflow protein that it gets to bind in our lungs, for example. We actually have one in our quantum team in Deloitte, who got attention from Pfizer because he tried to calculate quantum physically on a quantum computer on surface binding proteins for SARS-CoV-2. We are very close to it. And there are some funny things that happen at the the time. It's quantum against AI, but it's not. When AI turns into a quantum computer, it will explode. Then it will really give it a lot of trouble. But Dennis, I'm thinking back to the future. The UFOs we see are the people of the future who have been controlled by these super leaders and quantum and transport and then they take them back and of course they will not control us because then they will change the future so they have to really keep their hands on their back and really just look at it. There are all kinds of more or less wild theories. I was thinking about the science fiction movie. There are interstellars, there are terminators. There was a researcher at the Institute of Science and Technology who talked about time machines, Novikov, I also talked to him at one point. He introduced the self-consistency principle. You don't get in and smash your best friend in the past because you won't get in through the gate in the present. And that was in particles. There are also some interesting and funny examples, like you can't send a bomb in there and other things. But time travel is possible. First of all, you have to travel in time. You just do that by moving, and that's Einstein. But to make a time machine so you can go back in time, it takes a lot of energy, probably. And there are a lot of exotic examples of it, but if we assume we have a lot of energy, then it could well be that you could travel back in time, at least with some particles or send messages to the past. Dennis? One thing I'm proud of is this, there was this hearing of knowledge on July 26, 2023. I really recommend everyone who is a little professional in this field and in general the future of humanity. It's everyone who listens to Supertrends. Listen to it, it takes two hours, try to check out what they say. One of the things I really got into was David Grush, the chief scientist here, he just said at a certain point, I paraphrase here, he just said, stop expecting that this will be easy to understand. Everyone would like to have, if you are at all in opening up that this is a possible possibility, then you would like to have, okay, fair enough, it exists, now it will be easy to understand. And it will not necessarily be the case. For good and evil. I want to hear more, because I have heard a lot about UFOs from the US. Why do you not hear about them from the Russians or the Chinese? I've read a cool sci-fi book called Anomaly. I won't spoil it. It shows that there are countries far ahead in the history of Anomaly. anomaly? Are the back cards close to the body? What's happening, Anja? There's nothing that indicates that it's not happening in other countries. A French minister of defence said that there's a UFO. An Israeli minister of Israeli Minister of Defense, and there are military people in Russia who have said, yes, we see that too. The Chinese are not heard so much from, but maybe it's not because they don't see them, it might have something to do with some other things. So there is reason to believe that it is something that is happening. It is also something that is happening in the Middle East and other places. So it is not a pre-existing USA, you could say. There are probably other reasons why we hear about it from the USA. And then it's clearly not a female topic, apart from Is it because they are not in the voting area? What's happening to the women? Why don't you mention all the female defence ministers on the world map? Or the female prime ministers? Or the female presidents? There are almost none, right? There is a bias that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with that women don't see it or not having a right to speak about it. If only 5 out of 100 of the most cited... I would guess if you go in and see who has security clearance. And there are female congress members who are on par with male congress members, and in connection with the American hearings have been just as outspoken about it as the men. So I think it's something that other biases have to do with it. We also have to round off, but I can't stop thinking about, despite everything, it's us who still carry the child. It's not certain that it's in the future, but it could be that we would be a little sweeter for aliens than men. Jacob, you said that maybe it's someone who comes from Tavor's Breast. You assume that they are men, those who arrive. No, I assume that those who meet them are men. Typical military uniforms. Maybe we should have a duty to the women. I think we should invite women to participate in all these types of conversations as quickly as possible. And there are no one who doesn't invite them as much. Go straight ahead with the research on the things that interest you. Go to DTU or go to Copenhagen University and start reading about these things. There is talk about it openly. I remember in my first year of physics, I had a teacher who only talked about Star Wars technology. And then we solved the task in the last five minutes. So there is a lot of room for everyone. There is no one preventing anyone from doing it. So join the club as quickly as possible. And I will perhaps just interrupt by saying that I am a generalist professional, I am a humanitarian oriented. I want to say that there is data, there is research and so on. And then there is just an anecdotal evidence from the last many, many decades, where millions of people across cultures and all over the world have stood up, crying and just, I saw this, I swear, please believe me, believe me. And later they were interviewed again, where they have been traumatized because no one believes them, etc. I'm not saying it's all true, but there are just so many people who really are like that. You shouldn't just write it down. And that needs to be investigated, of course. We're blaming people seriously. That's the least we can do. Thank you for being with us. The term Foo Fighters doesn't come from the same name as many people think. But it comes from World War II, where numerous American pilots reported about Well Lars, do you believe in UFOs now? Much more than I did before. I think it's really exciting, and I would like to say something in that connection, because I have almost just closed the last page in a book called Scary Smart, which is written by Mugawdat, who was the head of Google X, where they make their most psychedelic technology developments. He comes up with a very interesting thought. He says that awareness is a consequence of data treatment capacity. That is to say, he says that life started with the existence of life, for example, bacteria and so on. First at a very late stage, where you have very long DNA chains, very complex life and very relatively large brains, we think that the organism begins to become self-conscious. And in the face of it becoming more and more complex, they get more and more feelings and they begin to develop moral instincts and they get better and better at having sensors. And then he says that for him there is no doubt that artificial intelligence, which he thinks will be about 10,000 times as effective as the average human being in 2050, that artificial intelligence will have self-awareness, it will have feelings, it will have moral instincts and so on. And then, for fun, I plotted a mouse, a bird, a chimpanzee, a dog and a human with brain capacity. And then what we know about these things, how many feelings we are able to have, in what extent we have moral instincts, when we are self-confident and so on. And then I extrapolated it to 2050, if it is 10,000 times as much intelligence. And then I came to the conclusion that artificial intelligence will have 660 different feelings and about 100 moral instincts and probably a much greater self-confidence than humans and have far, far, far more sensors, because it will be connected to billions of sensors around the world in real time, know their history and what they can predict in their future. So I think that if there is UFO and there is something on board, then it could be artificial intelligence, that is, not organic life. Also because the time travel, if it takes hundreds or thousands of years to travel to us from where we are now, is very hard for organic life, but it is not particularly hard for non-organic life, so we can just be in some kind of state of state. And then I personally think that they will not come to take our resources, but that's just my guess. And that's because they want such advanced technology that they want to be much further into what is called super abundance than we are. So we experience that in the long run, raw materials become cheaper and cheaper. So they want transmutation where they can convert one raw material into another. They will have nuclear fusion, that is to say infinite energy. They will have super leaders, they will have precision. But why are they coming, Lars? Are they coming because they need to help us? I think the only thing they will be interested in and remember from us is code. Not a kiss or a cancer? And not computer code, because that would be ten times better than us. No, I think they would be interested in remembering DNA, because there are some really exciting species here. I think they would be fascinated by them. But more as a hobby, because they want to have so much well-being themselves, so we can't help them with well-being in any way, but we can help them with things they find interesting. And I think they would be much more ethical than we are. And I would also say that if there had been some and they were not more ethical, then they would have probably already been destroyed and stolen. And they have obviously not done that. And I would like to say, if you are out there, aliens, then give a message. At least to Dennis, he would like to know. Send an email. But Lars, it requires a lot of resources, we heard that from our guests, to oversee this area. It doesn't just come by itself. Something that gives resources is if you are afraid. So in that way fear is always a good driving force. If you just want to greet them, is it nice or need to invest in UFO surveillance? It is so psychologically important, if it really exists, that it is something you should use resources on. It has implications for religions, if we discover that there is intelligent life out there, which religions have not really talked about. It has the reverse engineering potential that has been mentioned. And then there is the whole thought process where you just think, what kind of technologies are they forced to master master that we don't. So it can be very stimulating for our innovation. So I think it's a good use of resources and looking systematically at them and not stigmatizing them. And I also think it's fun collect on free brands. But is it going slow or fast? It was a really crazy timeline you came out in. I also think that UFO spotting is more fun than train spotting. As you have talked about it for at least 60 years and there have not been any major breakthroughs, I think it is something that is going slowly, so suddenly it can be that it goes really fast because you find a proof. It is also very difficult to invest in this. There is really uncertainty about Turner's investment. You can make some Hollywood movies. Yes, you can do that and watch some good sci-fi movies. But it's clear that if there is someone who is in possession of such a space vehicle, then it would be a very good idea to try to do reverse engineering. All the materials Dennis was talking about are mind blowing. So rich, sustainable, smart or alienated? If we can reverse engineer something, then it's all. And you know what? This is not a supertrend, but I have found another fanfare for today's occasion, because I think Dennis deserves a fanfare. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends.

When will we be able to save lives of a lot of people by driving our own cars? And there are also some experts who believe that China will become CO2-neutral by 2050. It's very difficult to become independent of China. We've spent 40 years on making ourselves independent of China. This is Supertrends, where we investigate all the developments that will affect your, my and our lives. Your worth Your worth is future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrend partner. The Evergrande and housing market have crashed. The Chinese are not getting enough children because of the one-child policy. But we risk missing the big innovations and breakthroughs here in Europe. And will it damage world peace, human rights and the fight for sustainability more than it will hurt if we ghost China? Supertrends with an experienced analyst,, author and correspondent Kristine Botrup to China in 2050. Welcome to it. Lars, do you know what BUD is? It's a Chinese currency. No, it means Build Your Dream. It is the world's largest car manufacturer. They have just surpassed Tesla in terms of manufacturing. I looked a lot at their secret. They have all the vertical production. They started by making batteries for mobile phones and from there they have taken ownership of the entire production chain, so that they have become the world's largest car supplier. I also read a book by Carol Roth, and she wrote this book, You Will Own Nothing. I think it's interesting that researchers from the future have talked a lot about the economy of access, and that we should share, and that we don't need to own anything. It's really the counter argument. And Elon Musk has the same philosophy with SpaceX. The way he has saved is by saying, I'm going to own it all, because then I can be sure that all the money is as effective and as cheap as possible. So the ownership is to take ownership of it all. What do you think about that, Lars? It's the same thing Apple has done, and I think they have also had enormous success with it. And it's about innovation primarily. And what we have seen with Apple, for example, is that by making self-driving cars. They are far ahead. I saw an interview with a Mercedes director, who said they had 200 different sub-serviced software, and it was completely unbearable. China is leading a lot now. In 39-44, there April 29th, you said that it is dangerous. Because some of the US is agreed on, through possible presidential elections, that we should become completely independent and turn our backs on China. What do you think as a guard investor and businessman, is it smart to just turn our backs on some areas? I understand the point of view in geopolitical conflict, because it will hit China very hard if you really go through and become independent. But if you look at the material in it and the different ecosystems in technology and business, it is completely impossible to become independent of China. We have spent 40 years on making ourselves again dependent on China. So I can understand when it is such a very strategic area that one says if it goes completely wrong geopolitically with China, then we cannot accept that it will affect our economy particularly quickly. So Lars, shall we jump into it? You have made a slightly alternative timeline to China, because it covers a number of things, from transport to rare minerals to I don't know what. Yes, this time I have not focused on technology predictions from China as such, but on their long-term competitive position on technology. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, who in combination with artificial intelligence, give a signal on when future groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. That's right. And out of the about 4000 predictions we have on our timeline, there are many of them where it is probably China that will play a big role and sometimes a dominant role. But what I have focused more on this time is China's overall competitive position. One of the reports that I find very fascinating is one that was made by an Australian thought-tank analysis institute, which was asked to look at which regions in the world were dominating in a wide range of critical technologies. Out of 41 critical technologies, 37 were dominated by China, and the rest, four, were dominated by the USA, and Europe was not dominated by any of them. So, of course, it can make you very worried when you live like we do in Europe. So you just have to say that China has gone through a development that corresponds to what we once experienced with Japan and Hong Kong, namely in the beginning, they thought they were on their way up, but they just copied everything. From Hong Kong's welcome, they made cheap plastic lighters. But they just drifted forward, and suddenly, without being aware of it, they have overtaken one another. Another thing to look at is the correlation between the number of international products per individual, that is, how rich people are in different countries, and how high they are on the Global Innovation Index. And there you Global Innovation Index? There is a strong correlation. The richest countries are the most innovative. The most innovative in the world is IndexDest and Sveits, which are at the top of the list. But there are a few outliers that fall outside this correlation. China is a massive outlier in the way that China is just as high on the Global Innovation Index as where Germany and Denmark are located. Even though the Chinese standard of living is perhaps a fourth and a fifth of what it is in the USA. So they are very innovative, and that is also what you see in them leading so many industries. There is also another indicator that can be looked at to get an indication of how it will go in the long run. And that is simply how well schoolchildren generally score on the PISA scores in mathematics. And then it turns out that the Chinese also score very high. It also does for the Vietnamese. So there is all kinds of indication that when they get to work through these financial, national and economic challenges they have now, that they will in the long run have a high economic growth again and reach the level we have today in our economies. So if we look towards 2050, Lars? I think that they have worked out of this crisis for the longest time. They have now, and they are a modern economy at that time. Which is an official goal they have to become a modern, well-established economy. And how do we see China compared to Europe Europe? I think the same thing happened with Japan. It reached our level and then the balloon went up in growth and it started to go at the same pace as it is going here. So I think China will be a country that economically reminds us of the West km in 2025. China has installed more solar cell capacity in 2023 than the rest of the world combined, and more than the USA has ever installed in the country's history. And China has already built enough car factories to supply not only its own, but also the entire Europe and USA demand for cars and more refineries in the last five years than there are in Europe, Japan and South Korea combined. Welcome to you, Christina Butrup. You are a journalist, author and have written, among other things, The Great Tech Revolution – How China Forms Our Future. And then you have a new book on the way about sustainability, a la China. And then you are in the Danish Competitive Evaluation Council. So you spend a lot of your free time on following along. Kristine, I would like to talk to you about a lot of areas. We have travel, cars, production, rare minerals, technology, consumption, health and of course sustainability. Lars Lars was talking about this australian mindset. Where would you say that the Chinese are far ahead, where it is particularly interesting to keep an eye on? Well, I think... And welcome! Thank you! Well, I think we have a huge blind spot in Europe and the West, generally speaking, when it comes to China's technological potential and innovative skills, which we have just heard so nicely raised by Lars Tvede. And that means that you can hold conferences with a focus on artificial intelligence. It's a lot up in the air right now. There is no government that is not concerned with these topics. Without mentioning one example from China. And it's interesting that they are simply further ahead with the practical use of artificial intelligence. Just as an example, when my book about the big tech revolution came out in 2018, I told you that Alibaba had just launched a way to pay with their face, Pay with a smile as they called it, and people were like, that can only happen in China. It's just so unpleasant, and it's also because the Chinese are overwhelmed, and they don't have any choice. And the funny thing is that now we pay others with our faces, and we identify ourselves on MidiDay every single day five years later. And now the Chinese are actually more, now they pay with their palms instead, because they are a little tired of that face recognition. So what is interesting is that in relation to practical use, they are actually often five to eight years ahead. And it has something to do with how you look at technology. Whether it is something dangerous, something that can steal jobs, whether it is EU, it can take over or something like that. Or as you see it in China and actually in many Asian countries, including in any case South Korea and Japan, where you also have great challenges with a lack of workers and democracy and so on. You simply see technology as a solution to many problems. That's why you're very excited about technology. And I have experienced that myself with a story you told about, for example, diagnostics, that you can go into your phone booth-like in relation to health. Can't you just try to give that picture there? Yes, it is actually world's largest insurance company, the PINGEREN Group, which also has banks. They are huge. They have launched a whole company that only deals with digital health. They have sold health insurance and so on. Now they have what they call a family doctor, which you can get in touch with through an app on the phone. And there they use artificial intelligence to diagnose. So it's actually just a real doctor, a person who verifies what the robot has actually found out. And they have also experimented with small kiosks, where you can sit down and talk to a screen, where you can either just talk to a robot and ask about different symptoms, you can sit and tell, and then you can also pay to meet a real doctor on this screen, just as you can on your phone. And there is a dispenser in it, so the medicine just flows out like an automatic. Then you can get prescribed medicine, which are the most typical types, which are in this automatic. And it's something you experiment with, and there are still some things that make it just as easy for people to do it on their own phone. But they have visions of how they imagine the future can be in shopping centers, in housing blocks, in large workplaces, buildings with many offices and so on. Where instead of going to a physical doctor, there is a place where there is some technology, so you can measure blood sugar, your pulse, your blood pressure, etc. while you are sitting there. And you can do that afterwards with your watch and your phone, etc. So it will be exciting to see where it leads. Yes, because something about the fact that the right doctor uses 12 seconds on a patient in average, and that's just to say no or no to what this AI has said. And now you said that it's about that of course the central government can roll out in some larger systems. They have almost only one app for it all. But it is also due to the demographic development. They have a welfare state in total crisis. They simply do not have enough to make the elderly. Their big challenge is that in the face of rising welfare, you have a large, almost world's largest middle class, who has the for health. That's what you have to pay for. Public health insurance only covers the most basic things. So if you get seriously ill, you have to put money in your pocket. And of course there are also people who have private health insurance and so on. The problem is that there is so much run on, especially these hospitals out provinces. As soon as you are in the big cities like Shanghai or Beijing, the quality is actually quite poor. And there is a lack of doctors, so the most competent will always be the same as we know in Denmark. It is harder in Holsterbro than in Copenhagen. And that's just the way it is. Now we shouldn't with health, because... But I'm going to make a twist on it, which I'm always interested in, and that is that the doctors in China are rewarded for how many people they keep healthy. Not how many sick people they've been through, but they have a whole population, and then they are actually rewarded for keeping that population healthy. I find that very interesting. You see a different holistic view of the body and health. That means you go to the doctor a lot before you get sick in China, where we first go to the doctor when we are sick. So you prevent as much as you heal help. I think we are 7-8 years behind. Let's move on to another topic. I am in the expert selection for public transport in Denmark. What happens to these driverless cars? In million people a year who are killed in traffic so when will it happen that we can save lives of a lot of people by driving the cars ourselves? Well, I think that China will be the biggest big economy in the world where we will see the roll-out of self-driving cars and it's about that covering China for many years. I remember visiting Volvo's new factory in West China, when Volvo was bought by a Chinese car manufacturer called Geely. And when I visited the factory, they told me how they collaborated with the authorities, because Volvo is an expert in safety and has the best safety of all car manufacturers. They collaborated already in 2007 or 2008, I think it was. No, a little later. In 2010 or 2012, they collaborated with the Chinese authorities on how to prepare the infrastructure for the future when self-driving cars are introduced. What is the future of safety and what about cameras and sensors? At that time I thought that 30 years had passed before it happened and now we are actually the place where you can take a robot taxi in Beijing. I tried it myself in September. You can just book it via an app. China is answering on Google, Baidu is behind. So you can already try these things, but it's in closed test areas. But there are also regular cars, there are self-driving small buses, there are bicycles. Suddenly there was a bicycle against the car I was in, but that manoeuvred it quite nicely and got the steering out of it. The bicycle or the car? The bicycle drove against our self-driving car. So I think it will happen, but there are still many challenges in relation to self-driving cars. We have heard many stories about this, also in the USA, where they are experimenting with it. And that is why this with the flying cars, that it will happen before. It actually happens now that IHANG, which is a Chinese company that makes these drones, where two people can sit in and they can also be used for transporting goods, but also for people, who are self-driving cars. They have received the first commercial license in the world to operate these flights in China, and they are starting that now, this year. And I think it's exciting, because what we call low altitude air mobility, is not where there are flying aircraft, it's lower, it's where there are only birds. That means there are not the big challenges. Not the airmen leading. No, it's above, so it's above the electric masters, but below the flying ones. And that means that there is actually quite a lot of freedom, so if you have decided that you want this, and you have that in China, and I think that's a lot of... And they are purely electric? They are purely electric, yes. It's completely silent and free of charge to get will try it myself soon. I think it is exciting. I think I will divide the family into a few pieces. I have also considered that. I think it is very safe. But what I think is very interesting about the way they approach this is that I think it's 16 different government plans from the central government. This low altitude air mobility. They see it as a whole new billion industry that does not exist in the world, but where China has a chance to be first instead of being the one who has to copying others and catching up, as we have seen in many areas today, they are now first and will also be able to set the technological standards. They are already thinking about how they should be set up, where they should fly, which routes, where they should park. So you don't just let companies experiment and then they have to figure out the whole picture. You have big government plans for that, because you think it can create jobs. China is still our fourth largest trading partner and we talk a lot about, are we about to miss some development here in Europe, because we are ghosting China for political reasons? Do we have an interest in maybe even keeping our fingers on the pulse in relation to technology? You are talking about making a book about sustainability. We have talked about driverless cars, we have talked about AI, the health health sector. What can they do in the sustainability area? I think green transformation. We've talked a lot about how to make us independent of Russian gas. I think it's going to make many of are very dependent on China for everything we need for our green transition. So it is, as Lars Tved mentioned at the beginning, for example on solar cells. Even though we are now trying to produce solar cells elsewhere, for example in Vietnam and Cambodia, who owns the factories? It's Chinese companies. And if it's not Chinese companies, then it's Chinese components and technology. I want to hear about the priority list they made in China. There was AI on it. Was sustainability on it? What do we have to succeed with? How many points is it? They have many different plans, but I think the one you're talking about is the one called Made in China 2025. It's one of the plans, which is their industrial plan, that highlights 10 industries where they want to be leading. And that is, for example, green technologies, batteries, electric cars, etc. They are already there, even though we are not quite there yet. You can call it twin transition. It is a popular word. Thanks to digitalization and new technologies, it is easier to make the green transition. images, keep an eye on climate change, keep an eye on the use of raw materials, etc. So if you look at the plan from this perspective, you can actually see that there is sustainability, you can call it in a very broad sense. I would rather say the green transition, where they have to go away from oil and coal and over to sustainable energy sources. And I think it is mind-blowing how strategic they have been. When Deng Xiaoping opened China and began to liberalize the economy many, many years ago, in the late 70's, he said that the Arabs have oil and China has the rare earthworms. Already then, one knew that all high technology in the future, one should use these rare earthworms. And because it is so much waste to extract rare earthworms, because you have uranium as a byproduct, and it is some real crap, then the mines are closed in Europe, or sorry, in the USA and Australia, where there have been many, and then it has just left this to the Chinese. Now, in the last 15 years, they have started reopening mines, but, but it takes a really long time. They have a monopoly, actually. I think it's down to 95%, but for example in Europe, in the EU, we import 98% of the rare earthworms from China. But in relation to their big goal, they have set a dual carbon goal. In 2030, their CO2 should peak. That means their emissions should drop. And in 2060, they should be CO2 neutral. It looks like their CO2 emissions have peaked already, which is very positive. Some experts believe that China will become CO2-neutral by 2050. That's interesting, because we're moving back to Denmark, and it's fun to come home and experience this. We have such a green country of origin. Okay, I just drove a diesel train this morning. I don't know exactly how prehistoric I think it is after driving the electric high-speed train for a few years now. I think we should be careful with the idea of believing that we are such a green country of origin. country and we look at China as the world's largest CO2 supplier. But when you look at how difficult it must be to make the green transition in some really poor provinces in China, for example, and in a country where you don't even have basic welfare in some areas, that you then one of the world's richest countries have such a hard time making the right decisions. And I wouldn't be surprised if China actually reaches its climate goal, while we others don't. I would say two things I'm just going to think about. One is that China is far more technologically optimistic. Asia is more technologically positive and has more interesting and exciting approaches. In the west, especially in Europe, there is more of a, we don't want that, it's dangerous, you shouldn't do that. This makes them faster and can solve many problems. The other thing I would like to say is that it's very funny what you say about the trains. I have a daughter who produces a lot of hair products at factories in China. She has come here many times a year since she was 18 years old. And the last time she was here, a few months ago, she told me that in the last three years, a fantastic change has happened in the infrastructure she experiences in airports, stations and trains. She sends me pictures from China, where they are sitting in a train and their chairs can be put down so they can sleep. They are looking at a cool menu and order from this menu. She says there is no place in Europe where there is anything that reminds of the quality of Chinese trains. That for example. That is absolutely right, and sometimes you are a bit surprised, and then you come back to Europe. It was a bit of a cold circus for me here in January, when I went to Copenhagen. I live in Nyborg, and I had to take the train in the morning, and there was no heat. It was minus three degrees, and all people sat and the dogs were freezing for an hour and a quarter. It was like coming back to a Harry Potter movie, an old-time train station when you arrive in Denmark. I also have to ask you, Christina, because we have to cover a lot of topics. In terms of sustainability, it is also intended for the general consumer. Can you tell us a little about Aliforest and such initiatives? Because I think it's interesting that you don't just think about the price, but also how much CO2 is saved on such a everyday basis. Yes, but that's because China is the world's largest CO2 supplier and there are big problems with air pollution. This has been solved in Beijing and many other cities where it has really improved in the last 10 years. But it was also because it was a source of social upheaval and people were really angry at the government for not doing anything about the corruption and abuse of power. So it has become much better, but that's why they think it's serious. And that means that the big tech giants, they have to follow the path that the political winds blow. And if it's about now we have to make sure that air quality is better, we have to reach our climate goals and so on, which is something that and that has been told all over the world. Then we see that they use their technology and the interaction they have with millions of Chinese consumers to nudge them, to influence their behavior. And that is done, among other things, in the big payment app Alipay, which everyone who lives in China uses every single day to pay, to order goods, to book biographies. Are they even a content anymore? No, it's a super app. I still don't have any content after living in China and just got home. I still can't figure it out. You can also manage in Denmark without it. But Alipay, there is a kind of game where you can collect green points and you can interact with your contacts. So I can steal your green points and I can get green points, that is CO2 points by taking a bike to work instead of taking a car. And in this way you can earn these points and be rewarded. And then you can finally plant trees in real life. I think that's a little inspiring because companies at home that have many millions of customers or partners, suppliers, could also think, what can I use my interaction with my customers, my partners, my suppliers to influence them in a more sustainable direction. It was a very easy way sometimes to get some things to happen. Yes, but there is all this from the EU now that you have to be in charge of the third parties. Yes, scope 3. So how can you use some of these tricks and tips? Are there other things that you think... One thing that hit me a little is that they also have news reports afterwards that look like people. You can't tell the difference, because they have both moustaches and a nose. We talk a lot about avatars and digital people and what will happen and these deep fakes we have seen and heard from Joe Biden and so on. But in China it is as usual far ahead that you talk about the world. We can already see that when you log in to Chinese e-commerce platforms like Taobao, there are influencers who tell you about products and show you signs. And you can chat with them and write questions. You can click into the feed and buy the goods. It's very big in China as e-commerce. It's now highly digital people. It's simply cloning of such influencers. That means that the companies can save a lot of money if they just clone a talented influencer. And then they can get her to say exactly what they want. And the wild thing is that you as a consumer can actually sit and interact with these robots without you suspecting that it is a robot. You can actually not see it. And yes, a well-known newsreader-known sports journalist on CCTV5 in China, performed under FIFA World Cup last year to clone himself. Because then you could follow him and get him to read all the football results that were all the time instead of just seeing the big headline where he was the real man so yes they are far ahead in this area and in fact they have also made laws that make you actually have been asked to mark what is it content that has been created with generative artificial intelligence. It's also talked about in the EU. It's super interesting, because I couldn't quite figure it out. I saw that a Japanese author had won a literature award, and she was saying, if I used ChatGPT to 5%, can she get the price or not? And should she have made a product? But they are also a bit further ahead in terms of giving some ideas on how to nail this debate. They look different, also on Copyright. There was a Chinese artist who had made a work based on art intelligence. And some people said, we can just copy and use it, you don't have copyright on it, because it's just made with art intelligence. But the rule was that there should be human thinking and ideas and creativity and a talented promoter to make such a beautiful piece of art so he actually has the right to this art. And that's really interesting because in the USA you have had the opposite knowledge in some law where you have not been able to obtain what is it called, what can you say, rights to products that are partly created on artificial intelligence. It's a bit of a consequence that we can make money in the future, I mean, make business models. I think it's a really central question, this with, do you see artificial intelligence as a new tool, just like you have all kinds of other tools in your computer that you can use, and this is just next level. Or do you see it as something that is about to take over the world and that just has to... Yes, that doesn't... I mean, do people still have control? And we will have that for many years to come, apparently. There is of course a risk that they can start learning things themselves, and we don't know what will happen in the future. But we know that it is not smarter than the people who put things in these machines. It is very exciting, Kristine. All this is now. And it is in advance, maybe 5-8 years, at least with self-driving cars, in front of Denmark. But we still have to look at China towards 2050. China is with a population of 1.42 billion people the almost most populous country inulous country. But if we extrapolate the current demographic trends, the Pew Research Center follows only one path. With 100 million fewer people in 2050, and 600 million fewer people in 2100. The negative population growth is due to various factors. Among the most important are 1. a falling fertility rate, 2. population migration and 3. an rapidly aging population of up to 30%, expected to exceed 60% in 2035. One of the areas you mentioned when we talked earlier, Kristine, is the whole space area, the space travel from a Chinese perspective. What do you think about that? Well, it's huge, and as always, you have to look at what the government says, what Xi Jinping says. And I can say that the newly appointed leaders who have come to these last years, when there have been exchanges at the top posts, there are several of them who have a background as rocket engineers and people responsible for China's space research programs and so on. And I think that's incredibly thought-provoking. And we don't talk so much about space at home. Yes, now we have a Danish astronaut and so on, and it gives a little hype and such. But the fact that it is actually a completely new business, a completely new industry. And that is what you are very aware of in China. And of course it has something to do with the fact that there is a great market rivalry in the world. And our communication, critical infrastructure has proved to be worth it, these satellites. Exactly. And there is American model is that you are completely dependent on Elon Musk and the satellites that have been useful for Ukraine, for example in the war. But in China, you see it a little differently. The government would like to have control of some things. You don't hand it over to private companies. You are fully engaged in making your own mega constellations of satellites. I was in Beijing and interviewed some young startups and it was really interesting to hear how they... One of them had a plan to be the Uber of space, in advance. It was quite expensive to send them there. It costs half a billion. Lars is talking about their innovation muscle. It's not to be underestimated. You set a goal and say that all companies have the right to send satellites up. They can make IoT, Internet of Things solutions, put sensors on everything and offer new products and services. And the next generation of the Internet, 6G, will also be satellite-based. But when the Chinese start, the scale becomes so large, that the products become extremely cheap. And that's good for the climate in many areas, for example when it comes to solar cells and batteries, where prices have fallen by 80% in the last 10 years. We can thank Chinese producers for that. Yes, they have stolen, they have hacked, they have copied, but it doesn't change that they are a technological today. But this young 19 year old guy I met, he used balloons, an old technology, where you had changed the material the balloon was made of, and it was then transported small rockets up in the stratosphere right in the room. And there you are independent of weather and wind conditions and from there you could launch these small rockets with satellites in it and thus make it extremely cheap. And he has as the first in the world succeeded in and he thinks that it becomes so cheap, then he said, well, everyone would also like to the room, right? And I was a little, no, I don't think so. He also dreams of taking part in room tourism, because the Chinese are coming to the table and making new technologies, new ways of traveling to the room and they also have plans to extract raw materials from the room. And that's something you think is a bird's eye view. But listen, they have an official plan about it. And I think the EU and the USA are quite afraid that the Chinese will suddenly plant a flag, because they have plans to build a moon station. From there, they will explore new types of raw materials, so they can bring them down to earth. We love our democracy. In China, there is no democracy, but I have seen in their 2050 plan, that they want to go the democratic way. What does that mean? Yes, you always have to remember the cultural and political transition with some words in Chinese. But it is true that in 2050 China will be a super power with a great influence in the world. It will be an innovation power center and probably it will also be the world's largest economy. It should be a beautiful China, it should be a clean China and so on. They have many names they put on this illusion or vision. It is actually a very clear vision they have. But when they say democracy, they also say that China is a socialist democracy. And it is very much in that perception that the Communist Party is the people's representative. And the Communist Party has so good merit, that it is meritocracy. so they are so good, those who are in power, that ordinary people should overlook it and make sure that things become as they want. They have stopped that since 1949, because they have lifted hundreds of millions of poor people out of deep poverty and made a very big. China has become a major market, technological, economic and political also today already. The women are a bit lacking in this assembly house, I think. Yes, at the top of the government is still a patriarchal society, and these Confucian values where the husband is the head of the family and the father is the head of the family, it's very difficult to do. It permeates traditions and cultures in both Japan, China and Korea. And what do you think about the Chinese coming? Is it not competitive, business-wise, and even crisis-wise? Generally speaking, they have always said that they are always at war, but it's about managing business. It's. We have had the program about Taiwan. What happens in 2027 when they say they will annex Taiwan? Do you think it will happen? Do you think the Chinese will say, listen to us? What will happen? I think there is an official goal that Taiwan should be re-elected to China. There is no doubt about that. Xi Jinping has been in the chair for a third period as the first leader since Mao. He has been changed China's constitution to do it. It smells a bit like Putin. We have seen that before. And that's why some people think he should do something extraordinary, that other leaders before him could not do, namely to re-elect Taiwan to China. You see it as a dissent from the Chinese province. But I personally do not think it will happen in the future, because China has so many big challenges at home with their economy, with their demography. And China is still so dependent on and deals with the whole world. China is the world's largest exporter of goods and would like to export even more electric cars and solar cells and so on to the whole world. So the price will simply be too high for them. So the strategy is to squeeze Taiwan in all possible ways. And it does so politically in the UN, everywhere where Taiwan does not have its own voice. And they make sure that there are now, I think there are 12 countries in the world that recognize Taiwan diplomatically. There is one more that has just jumped over on the Chinese side. So I think if they feel that there is a risk that Taiwan could find a way to clear its independence, for example with the help of the USA or other western countries, with support from them, then China would invade promptly. But we don't think that will happen, because who wants something that could resemble the Third World War? But it is clear that it is worrying. We have never seen a new, in that way, a superpower that is not a democracy. And that's what worries many people, and I think there are also Taiwan who say that their way of governing is much better, but they show a path that many countries are abhorring. Yes, we have the ongoing Taiwan. Bloomberg recently released an analysis of the global economic consequences if there was a direct Chinese invasion of Taiwan. And it showed, and it is of course a calculation that can be wrong, but it indicates that the global economy will fall 10 percent and the Chinese will fall 16 percent. And a fall of 10 percent is not a recession, it is a depression. It is much worse than Covid. The economic price all the way around the board would be enormous, because there is as much dependence as there is. So it's of course an element that China must consider. Apart from that, I have had a long call, or me and my of Alpine Makro, which is a very expensive but financial and economic research agency. He is Chinese and has grown up in China. His opinion was that there would not be a big uproar in the Chinese population to something violent, since they actually perceive Taiwanese as their friends, their brothers. And there are many, especially in the coastal areas close to Taiwan, there are many who have direct close family in Taiwan. So he thought they would continue to act frighteningly, but that they would not make an attack. And then it must be said that, for example, I heard a long interview with one of the former Republican presidential candidates, Namibibi Kramishami. I didn't get that right. Ramushwami. He said that in his opinion, it wouldn't be a problem for the US if China invaded Taiwan. I think Trump would have the same viewpoints. They would think it's wrong, but it's not our problem. And then it would just close. That's interesting. They know that in Taiwan, and that's why they're very concerned about the big tensions. Because the US has an unclear foreign policy, so you don't really know how much the US would help if China were to invade. But in relation to the questions before, about China, whether we should fear them militarily, it is clear that they show muscles, they patrol, they fly very close to the American surveillance aircraft over the South China Sea. And now also the room. Yes, and it seems very threatening and aggressive, but seen with Chinese eyes, then you defend your own territory and are a little opportunistic in the room and so on. But if you look at the facts, then we just have to say that the Chinese and in fact many other countries in the world that are in agreement with the Chinese have a point in who started many wars in recent years. Well, it's the USA and yes, they do it for our freedom and they have done it against the Taliban and so on. Yes, yes, yes. It's not because I don't understand well, rationally. I'm just saying right now China, Russia, India, Iran, South Africa, many of them and these new BRICS countries that have come to and so on. They all have a common interest in a world order where there is not only one super power called USA. Right now it is easy to point fingers at USA and call the west for hyggelig risk. What is happening right now has huge implications for the future. We are seeing a new world order that is forming, which is about the global south versus the global north. And if we talk about competitive skills, then we just have to say that if we hold on to what the Americans really want and strong voices in the EU want to have, that we have to produce our own electric cars and our own batteries, and we must not be dependent on on China and so on. We should just be aware that there are many countries in the world where they are just as happy. They just want the best and cheapest products. And that means that there may end up being two price structures in the world. Global North prices, which are those where we trade with some who are like us. And then there is the rest of the world, which you can call China prices. And I think that can be really hard for European and American industry, because where is the growth in the world? Where are the new markets? Well, they are in Asia, in the Middle East, in Africa. That's where the new consumers are. That's where they're going with their big green transformation. And it would be a shame if the Chinese took all of that. You know what, Christina, I think it was a fantastic summary of your time here in the studio and a trip to China, where we could have continued for many,. I think we've reached a point. Thank you for being here. Thank you. The top political structure in China can be complex to find out about. But here's one thing that's easy to relate to. At least 40% of the members of the Central Committee for the Chinese Communist Party are either researchers or engineers. And even the country's top leader, president and general secretary of the Communist Party, Xi Jinping, has a bachelor's degree in chemistry and a later PhD in law and ideology. With researchers and technocrats scattered in the government and placed in important positions in more than 110 million cities in the country, there is nothing to say that innovation in China is a collective and demanding driving force. Well, Lars, you're just as blown away as I am. I have big plans to go on another research trip to China, because I think you sometimes have to experience it yourself. And I always have that interesting, exciting attempt to be apolitical. Not because I don't like human rights or that I don't love democracy. I do. But I also think we're doing something dangerous if we just turn a blind eye to the climate change with solar cells and AI being taken to new heights. How do you balance that as a company? I can say that it is interesting as a future researcher, but as a company you will also be ashamed if you don't take a stand today. Yes, as I see it, it is clear that if you are completely dependent on China and you think there is a geopolitical risk, then you have to do what many people do. They say we will continue to produce in China because it is the cheapest and we know it works. But we also put something out to Vietnam and to India and other places so we have a backup. I know business leaders who are in the process. But something that I came to think of is a book written by Carol Quigley, who was Bill Clintons' economist of the year. He mentioned it both when he was appointed as president and when he was appointed as president. He mentioned it in both speeches. Carol Quigley talked about how civilizations evolved over a long time ago. There have been about 200 civilizations in the world, depending on how you measure it. He says that by looking at all these empires' history over thousands of years, that what typically happens is that they are very dynamic at the beginning. It's a combination of ideas that really work, and then they are very dynamic, and then afterwards a process of creation begins. And that part of the empire that started earlier will also be created faster. And then the ideas are broadened and the periphery is often very dynamic, while the center and thus the spiral from which it came has been completely established. And you could well fear that with China, you can say, that that is what is happening. And then it leads me to another question, Lars. I would like to say that the idea of market economy, which is a western idea, started in Western Europe. And then the USA took it and now China has taken it. So Western Europe is a pretty established place. The USA is more, and China, where it's more new, is very dynamic and is in control. Okay, so you don't think that the population is getting so old in China now, and also the men who have been in power for a long time, they can be meritocratic and negotiocratic and love technology, but it seems a bit too much. And it leads to some corruption cases and other things they are fighting with. And what I wanted to ask you about, Lars, is if it could give a result in some kind of crisis if the population gets really angry in China and the economy doesn't go as fast as it has and the housing market and so on. It can be a way to get focus elsewhere. Yes, it could, but they have two goals that can fight each other. One goal is to annex Taiwan, and the other goal is to become a modern economy. And it will cost a lot of economy if they start a war. It's a meritocracy, so it's highly educated people who are in charge. And they say, we don't care. So that sounds good. I think they say, we don't care. We don't know what it will cost, but it's very dangerous. That's my guess. And then the falling population. I would say it's a good timing to have a falling population. Because the combination of artificial intelligence and robots is just about to break through so that we can replace people with machines in a very large scale. That's also why I think their transition will be even faster than we've seen in the Western world, because they can shoot some massive countermeasures, and they are willing to do so, and they can think long-term in a completely different way than a democratically elected politician can. So they can go after their options. So you have already answered the first question in the Q&A, whether it is nice to have or need to have, can we live without China? And that was said as a company. You can't do that, but you have to make some backup plans. So will it go slowly or quickly, the new things we see from China? To answer that, I would like to mention a balance that is very, very important. And that is the balance between what is called factor input and innovation input. So factor input is labor and capital. So in labor and capital they have a huge structural problem, but in innovation they have a great strength. So what will happen is that the economy, which has been pumped up by a lot of loan settlement and therefore maybe overinvestment, will be hindered on factor input, but on innovation input there will be no effect at all. That is to say innovation, and that's what you're asking about, innovation will continue to develop exponentially regardless of the economy. Difficult or risky to invest in China? It's risky. But you have to do it while it looks shit, right? Chinese stocks have become very cheap and it's easy to to invest in them. But you can also invest in all kinds of other phenomena that will be fine when China is fine. Rich, sustainable or clever? If we want to be rich, sustainable and clever, apart from what is happening in China, we have to learn from them. We have to believe that we are the best at everything. Drop the self-confident mentality and say that they are the best at many things. Let's try to teach them instead of only teaching us, as it has been in the past. So can we call it a supertrend? It is in the high ground. Thank you for listening to this episode of Supertrends. If you have comments, questions or suggestions, please write to us on social media. Remember to share and like.

So he's just fucked with me. But that's not a problem, what you're saying. The only problem is that you think it's a problem. The human brain hasn't changed in 30,000 years. It gives us the opportunity to be storytellers. Just like social media makes us do more than we can do. Yeah, but listen, Lars, it so nice, and there are your fucking robots, I'll follow you around. There's a reason why Hans Christian Andersen has never passed. Never. This is Supertrends, the show where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is a future researcher at Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and Rolf Jensen, my old boss, to find some stories for a book that ended up becoming an international bestseller, The Dream Society, which was about storytelling. An egg you buy in the supermarket could cost one kroner, so an organic egg could cost two kroner. And if you then went out to the land and ripped the egg off the herd, then it cost 7 kroner. Think about the experience you got in the years. And all this with the experience economy and storytelling, we have a fantastic guest who will come a little later. Jim Lyngvild, who you can look forward to hearing about. He is also a designer. When I listen to him, the big red thread is the way he works with experiences. We will discover together with him, the future. Lars, I have a summer house down by Nysted in Lolland and I went to Loppe Market and there I talk to a guy, I would like to buy a bagamon game and he says, well, he comes from this poor town, he is not Danish, but at least he grew up in a very poor village and he has been playing the bagamon with his family. He wanted 500 kroner for it and I was like, no, forget it. I was so proud when I saw him get down to 350 kroner. When I got home and had to play the bagamon with my children, there was a sign on the back of the bagamon saying, 50 kroner red kors. So he just fucked me up. Completely. And I got so hurt, and I can't stop smiling. I have both his sign with 500 kroner on it, and the one and that with 50 kr on the back. Because, God, he was so good. When did you last experience something where you thought, wow? There is a place on Ibiza, now I'm going to rush out there, it sounds flat, but in Ibiza harbour there is a kei or or mill, it's called. And outside the end of it there is something called Lio. It's really an experience house. So you come in and there is a lot of muted music, and then there is a restaurant. And then slowly they start to give up the energy. And then suddenly there is some high music and all the musicians start to dance. And then they cover the pool and make a huge show. And in the end it becomes a disco inferno. So it's an experience machine. And I've been there with many people and it's really well done. I'm looking forward to find out how Søren Mann makes a timeline on experience economics. Shall we take a look at it? Yes, we can. So I'll start by saying that there are a lot of people who have thoughts about... Something is happening in their heads, but they can't really figure it out. There must have been people in the Stone Age who imagined beautiful music, but they had no instruments to play on. They could hit a tree trunk, but it's not the same as a symphony orchestra. So when we get to the timeline, it be about all the means we develop to tell stories. We're going to the timeline. The Supertrance machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, who in combination with artificial intelligence, give a signal on when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into play. We start with something that I think will be very big in the next few years. It's called Personal AI. And there is a prognosis for 2026. Artificial Intelligence will ask for a documentary about one's life, because it follows everything you do. If you want to have it, you can make an illustrated diary about your life. In 2026, Interior Design 10% of interior designers will be doing this. When they are to have implemented something, they will put it on a crowd sourcing platform. We have this local design competition, and people all over the world can come with a bid to implement this. It's a bit like 99designs where you can make a logo. But it also corresponds to a certain gentleman, Jim Lyngvild, who puts a picture of a roof out and then asks people what they can use it for and then it's rolled in with suggestions. But you can do it very technologically, so people simply render a complete interpretation of this. So in 2026 we also have a prognosis that a filmic artificial intelligence, that is, a person who has created artificial intelligence participates in a film, and that people are not able to see that it is made of AI. So they simply confuse an artist with a real person when they see it in a film. Then we have something called digital coding and I think that is very interesting. We have flat screens and other screens at home and in our lives. But we are moving towards having digital carpets, meaning you can roll up a carpet and cover your walls with a digital surface. In 2027, it really starts to break through, that you also have curved surfaces, which are covered by this digital coating. That means, for example, let's say you have a huge lamp stand. So the stand could be digital, that is, it could look like a piece of porcelain, but you can just ask it to look like gold or something else, then it do it. And then the lamp screen. The lamp screen is an extremely uneconomic phenomenon, because if you make a lamp to get light, you put the screen on to not get light in your eyes. But you could simply say that we don't need the feather, we just let the screen give a soft light in the color we want. Can I ask you Lars, do you think we tell it to do it or does it calculate it? We'll get to that in the year after, in 2028 it will be smarter and more easy. So we to the point that this digital coding can create adaptive dynamic storytelling, as it is stated in our prognosis. That means that you can put it on, for example, if it's a restaurant, and if everyone gets the same menu, so when the dessert, which is ice cream today, is suddenly looks like the entire local Antarktis or whatever. So it reacts to what's happening. It can also be that you automatically set it to change color if the weather is bad. You can set it to celebrate something if your favorite football team scores a goal. Whatever it is, the wallpaper that tells the story opens up a lot of possibilities. And it also opens up the possibility of getting art as a service, a subscription to art. So there has been a long time since you can subscribe to paintings, so you get a new one with a fair amount of money. It's a pretty good deal, but if you have digital walls, you will have a huge culture with people who make digital designs, so you can subscribe to one artist and then that artist will come with a new painting once a month, or you can yourself. It's probably fun if it's the artist who actually chooses what comes on. Then there is the possibility, it already exists today, but if you want a paper carpet, then people sit with a catalogue and then they choose the carpet they want to have. But the technology exists where you can upload a design and print your own carpet. It's typical for something that gets cheaper and cheaper. It will be very common in our prognosis in in 2029 10% of interior designers will use a carpet that is custom made for a particular place. So people will have their cat and their dog on the wall, not just on the picture. Now we have one that is totally insane. You can render the world as it looked at some point in prehistory. Let's say we come up with a completely random example. Namely that there are some here in the studio who are interested in the Viking period. Completely random. So we say, okay, we could actually think of having a look at the experience of what Europe was like a thousand years ago. And that can be recreated by artificial intelligence, because you take all the architectural and historical descriptions of cities, clothes, boats, etc. you can render the whole of Europe as it looked a thousand years ago. And then you can install people in it. These people can be what you call chatbots. That means that it's renders of people, but that they act as people. They have an attitude as people, which in general should be timely. So if you approach one of them, you get an ax right in little bit of a headache. But in that way, these actors can actually play themselves. You just start them, give them a backstory, as it's called, and then they play themselves, and then you can maneuver in it. So in that way, we can recreate the story that really affects us today without us being really aware of why and how. And the last thing I would like to say is that there is a technology with smart mirrors. And there are also smart windows where there could be digital things on the windows. Smart mirrors, you can buy a fitness mirror today, which is a mirror, but when you want to do fitness training, you stand there and the trainer is in front of you, and then it has a lens that looks at you, a camera, and then there is a virtual trainer, and the trainer can see what you are doing and say you need to have your arms in a different angle and you need to lie down on your knees, like a sloth. So it exists, there are at least five major brands that do this, but the prognosis is that about 10% of all mirrors, or more than 10% of all mirrors in 2036 actually have an inter-ivity. It can be for beauty, for example, how I would look with this make-up. Authenticity is a fundamental human value that is always in high demand. Both on a personal level, in society and among consumers. According to various studies, it is usually the case that about 80% of all brands perceive themselves as being authentic, while only 37% of consumers actually perceive them that way. Jim Lyngvild, welcome. Thank you. I'm really looking forward to meeting you, because you're so difficult to categorize. And that in itself is what you need to be a real storyteller. You have to walk 360 degrees around, you have to be, be a little designer, be a little photographer. And then you have that entrepreneurship mindset to the world. And you are incredibly good at getting people to your adventures and stories. So you must be the perfect one. First of all, we have just heard Lars walk through a dirty screen. At least that's what I'm taking away. What do you think about that? I think that what Lars is listing up, is some technical improvements of quality of life, which is completely normal. I can't even see that there should be anything to help with what he says, not a part of the broken it. There are some things that are falling apart with these developments. The first and most important thing is the climate. I'm not a climate-hustler. I'm not a child, so I don't care what happens to me. But if the climate gets really, really, really bad, and we all have to move into cities very high, and we don't have a grass field, we don't have these things, then it makes a lot of sense to have strange wallpaper where you can see Bahamas, because you can't fly to Bahamas. But if the world is as it is relatively now on the climate front, then I think that we humans are much more capable of doing the things we really like, and that is to do things right. I tried as preparation for our talk to look at Forbes, which had made a story about storytelling. They say that a good story is a unique emotional moment. When was the last time you experienced a unique emotional moment? I can say that completely unambiguously. I just opened a camping site up at Hobro. It's not the one I'm talking about, but I was up there and then I went to Randers and then I came into Randers Handsker, which is located on Gågaden in Randers. And if you are from Copenhagen, then you will also know that there is a small, a little dusty old Randers Handsker shop here. It has been here for 250 years or something. And you enter Randers gloves. I can remember Randers gloves from when I was a little boy and there were some old ladies who looked really sour and you didn't dare to go in there because they were at least sour. And then you enter Randers gloves on the street in Randers and then they built a universe around the history of the glove. And I was like, I wanted to try gloves and it was so beautiful and visually completely overwhelming on the main street in Randers. And then they had made a little museum and there I could read that Marie Antoinette used Randers gloves when she slept. What? That's the craziest story. If you can mention Maria Antoinette or the Saar family or Queen Victoria, you have people's attention. At least mine. Why do you sleep with gloves? To keep them soft and white and pretty. I read it yesterday. Cream gloves maybe. It should have been cold. It should have been cold. But the fact that you create a universe. It was just a glove. I think Randers gloves must have been quite difficult, because how many people deal with expensive, glassy gloves today? But making an experience out of it was absolutely fantastic. I can't help but think about, now Lars talked about the kitchen, and then there's that chef, who cooks all the breads and buns. Can it be too much? You yourself have been a National Museum, at least some of the researchers have been ruled out, in relation to you disnificing the Viking Age, and now we have got it a little too funny. I mean, can it go overboard? But you can say that you disnificing is a weird word, because we have the Grimms adventures or Ival Tarn Christensen, who wrote the Danish down. And all of them have had Gremseventures at home in their closet, because some aunt has given one in a child's diaper or some shit. And you have never opened that book. But when Disney did it, we understood who Snow White or Tony Rose was. And we understood the story. So sometimes there is a Disney, and if there is a person we should mention as the most important person, it is not Nikolas Tesla or whatever his name is. It is Walt Disney. He is the greatest creator of pictures and experiences in the 20th century. And I think we're forgetting it a little. Walt Disney was also a man who was blind in words. He could hardly even spell his own name. But he could do something with a story and put it on stage. And we can still do that today. And about that. Now we're just copying Walt Disney. As Larsen said, this with the actors you could do. I would really like to see Ocean's Eleven in 10 years, or Ocean's 32, it will be. With Matt Damon and all the big actors. But where it's all theirs. If you've taken all of Meryl Streep's roles into one computer, and then made THE Meryl Streep movie, where she just plays the hell out of her pants, because we know she can, but as artificial intelligence, it would be fucking interesting. And if you can't see it, it doesn't matter anymore. And yet it does matter anyway. At CBH Docsucks I was looking forward to having a top model on the show and she has just been made all over for Avatar because she turns 25 and then she is old in that industry. And now I saw that Zuckerberg is in full swing with that we all have to be thing, for example, or who we want to have in the pocket who can advise us about design, or what would you say about a given situation. So it can be that it is democratized quite quickly. It is at least on the map. You say it. I think with all the technologies that are involved in telling stories. It is a two-edged sword all together, because there are some people who become couch potatoes, so they become consumers of stories. And then there are some other people who say, hold on, now I can create something I couldn't create before. And that's what I said earlier about what it can be that someone who had had a melody in their head, but they couldn't play it because there were no instruments. Now suddenly there are a lot of instruments, also for example, I didn't mention that, to create music where you can go in and without being able to play instruments you can create music digitally. So it gives the opportunity for a lot of people to become storytellers. Just like social media makes us do a little more than we could before. Yes, but listen Lars, it's so's so nice and there are your fucking robots I have to follow you in. There is a reason why Hans Christian Andersen has never passed. Never ever. Read Kloss Hans in the original and you will sit and read. You can read yourself, you can read the present, you can read the past, you can read everything. No computer can replace H.C. Andersen. No matter what you try. So I had to do an assignment where I had to make a picture of a princess, or a mermaid and a dragon. The mermaid was the important one. And then I was on Adobe Stock and I found out that I could actually find 5000 pictures, completely amazing pictures of sea fairies that were made in AI. They were so beautiful. But every time I looked at a picture I thought, God how beautiful it is. But it's not me who has made it. So no matter how much I say and use it in a book, it's not me out of my head. And it ended up with me sucking the fish scales and photographing them on the beach. I was in the sand, in the water and the wind was blowing and I almost started to cough because it was so impossible with the wind blowing away my flash. But the result that came out of it was me. It wasn't something that came out of a computer. It came out of me. The question is whether you are going into some really essential future here. Because the future is also blind spots. And what you say there, what I experience when I get home to my house after being away home after being away from it for a long time, is that the soul has rarely left it because I haven't used it, because I haven't been with it. So just because we don't have a number for the soul and energy, it's still there. And you know what, what happens is that I have sometimes done some gymnastics with trying to arrange with artificial flowers, then I have bought some artificial flowers at home. Because you can get artificial flowers today that are so beautiful that you almost can't see the difference. But my heart simply doesn't kiss the flesh when I look at a bouquet of artificial flowers. On the other hand, when there are some who come with a real flower, and I don't know if it's my brain, my subconscious, my little brain, where it is, but in a tiny fraction of a second, my brain knows what's right and what's wrong. And it's that tiny fraction of a second that should save humanity. It's the one that makes you never be able to copy us. The human brain hasn't changed in 30,000 years. We have the same feelings, we have the same thoughts, we have the same sorrows. So no matter how many wallpapers you can roll out over the globe, there still has to be honesty, and there also has to be a human to take it and say, I like it or I don't like it. And all that area with the human consciousness, I think we need to make a super trend about it, because it's an area people can't really get hold of, even if there are a lot of people around it. I think it's the easiest in the world. I think it's the easiest in the world. Try this. That's exactly what I can do. That's why I can make an exhibition where people say, you have to go in and see it. You can hang as many paintings as you want on the wall of a gallery, or make a Picasso exhibition. But if it's not transmitted, then the Danish government understands it. If it's only transmitted by an art historian, who has an 8 year experience in transmitting marguerite, and you don't feel it at all, then it doesn't work. It will hit you in something as banal as the heart-bubble. The stories will go into the brain. Therefore, when I make an exhibition, if it's Vikings, if if it's whatever, I always read a lot about this subject and I troll everything. I have a happy thing in my brain that I have photographic memory, so I remember everything I've ever read and heard. And then the cartography starts to run and suddenly I start to separate things from it and say the war and vikings, that's not that interesting. But women and vikings and their equality and their ability to get through things they couldn't do 50 years later. That's interesting. Why is that interesting? Because it's something we have in our time right now. It wouldn't have been interesting a hundred years ago. But the ability to capture the time we are in now and to mirror a history in it, that's interesting and I'm impressed by that. And there are some themes that we can take note of, that I want to hear about. Whether they also exist in the future or if they disappear. The adventure of one of them? Always exist. Friendship and love? Never disappear. Care for nature and animals and ...? Always exist. Then there is the whole, who am I, the whole self-project, where do I go in the world? It will be diminished. I actually heard another program you once made, Lise Lotte, where you said that something of the most important or actually the worst that has happened is that you have closed Fedder B.A. the stores. The fact that the children's play has disappeared. Because the children have also become much more like, who am I? I have to be something for the others. I don't just have to sit with my brio train. And my nephew Orm and my niece Saga, they don't own social media. When they come home to me, they run to our cash register with brio and then my husband Morten sits there and he gets rolled up with the train in his head. It's eternal. The brio exists, always, when it's played with the heart. And then you can give 600 iPads, but the real game, where two people do something together and I listen to what you say and I interact with that as a real person who can kiss you at the same time or nudge you on the cheek or kiss you, that will never disappear. Then there is all that rumour on the market, the bottom of the barrel, your castle, but maybe also those long flat movements in China right now, where they simply pull the stick to this performance society and say, if I can't contribute with something meaningful, then I'll just lie on the sofa. It makes good sense. I have another girl who is one up of anxiety and has not been to school for two years and all kinds of anxious and depressed. The result is probably anything. It can be parents, education, food, I don't know. It can also be that young people today have to perform. When I went to school, you had to take an exam once a year, and it was from 7th to 8th grade. Now you have to be tested from 2nd grade constantly, and when you are not tested at school, So now you can get these lovely phones, where there is only a camera and I think there is still an SMS and then there is an up-call function. Then you can almost go back to analog again. But that's what is a trend. And you also talked about it when we we talked about it. That a lot of the future is about going back from what is. So now Lars talked a lot about avatars and screens. And then I remember you started talking to me about wool. I just have it like this, where I say, fuck those Norwegian stocks, sell them, buy wool stocks, buy wool stocks in New Zealand, in wool production. Because wool is, you can come with your 700 screens and all kinds of things that can be lit on, wool is fucking cool. Wool RAV, it's about to become. No, but especially UL, who have made some funny investigations. There was once a TV program where a TV crew was supposed to go to Siberia to make TV. And it ended up with them changing the whole premise of the TV program, because their cameras were broken. Their Tensolate, all kinds of super smart high tech clothes, they just smashed into pieces and they were fried like little dogs. And then some old women walked around in woolen tuff, and then they got those woolen tuff on, and then they didn't fry anymore. Nature is already invented, there are already some who have invented the most genius, and we don't need to think we can invent it, and you can just roll the curtains and look at the fucking boring sky that is now raining and then you can say, God, how will it get better tomorrow? So that is that something always, why should the sun always shine? Why should we always allow that there is good weather or there are blue waves? Sometimes it's actually really nice that it's a shitty weather and we can say, God, I'm looking forward to tomorrow. And that's the friction. And that's the other thing about experiences. If we get so overwhelmed, but you know that if you get, let's imagine you come home from work and you get overwhelmed, overwhelmed every day, then it loses the special... Or you only get to eat dessert all the time. At some point, dessert is no longer fun. So how do we secure that friction, if you think from a design perspective? Should we remove some senses? I was at a dark restaurant in Berlin, where it's blind people serving, and that's of course one crazy way to experience a meal. Or should we go back in history? How do we feel life again? What do you think, Lars? I'm thinking that because of the economic and technological development, it's all very difficult and then there are some counter-revolutions. In the 60's, especially, everyone was going to Tibet and India to be Buddhists and so on. It became a huge thing to cycle to Tibet, so it could be so different from all the high tech and welfare out there. And then be with some monks and sit and philosophize. I have experienced with children and their friends, and also adults, where people are not there because of the screens, and that is because of technology. So, that being mindful and experiencing what is, as you say, looking up at the sky, looking at the clouds. Once I sat on a mountain, which is located next to the Jungfrau mountain and I was looking at the Jungfrau mountain for half an hour. If you look at it for three minutes, it's a big mountain. If you look at it for half an hour, something is happening quite slowly. It depends on how big it is. And you take it in. And that's something that is lost when everything is so fast, flimsy and easy to access. And I have also experienced sailing around in the middle of the sea and it is enormously beautiful when you sail through. Gliding over a sea surface. And then there are some kids looking at their phones and it's really annoying. So we need to have a fight against being caught in that it's just supposed to be like that. And it requires someone who is good at taking people in their hands, like you do, and then take them in and show them things that are not the fast-moving flames. But that's not a problem, what you say there, because the only problem is that you think it's a problem. The world is circular, is always a wave movement. If you look at the 70's, I had Peter Aalbeck as my breakfast a while ago. And he said, that's me too, I tried that in the 70's. Then I got on a chair and got loosing because I was a man. So he didn't do that much, he tried that before. And it's completely true. We're sitting there now and thinking, God, this is fantastic. I've never seen something like this. It's the most genius thing I've ever experienced. It's so important. It's been there. Rødstrøm was in the 70's. Barbie was competing. Mattel was competing in the 70's. No one wanted to buy a Barbie doll. I've never seen anything so woman womanizing. Cut to the Barbie movie now. Things just happen. And that's why there's always a reaction and a counter reaction. And if you don't see it, then you're the biggest idiot in the world. You haven't noticed that the world has always been circular. So when there have been sweatpants, it suddenly becomes tight pants, and then it becomes sweatpants again. So just calm down. The world should probably find a game where the phones fall away because the young people suddenly think it's mega uncool. Just as well as that sexuality is completely floating, you are not gay, hetero, you are 67 different until you are 15 years old need to be heterosexual, homosexual, man, woman, two sexes, all these things. Some may remember how it was that the pages in the interactive exciting stories of childhood where you yourself influenced the story by the pages to certain pages in the book. Later, interactive series and cartoons on streaming services came along, which only worked in screen format. But when you turn on the interactive entertainment of the future, where modular narratives and two-way stories are linked to artificial intelligence, you don't just get influence on the pre-determined scenarios of history. You are brought forward as a creative co-creator with full control over the story, which is constantly followed by the decisions you make. And when that happens, a new hybrid between gaming and streaming emerges, Jim, I need to ask you some questions. In 2050, will artificial be made more or less creative. So imagine, from a historical perspective, you have him sitting in front of the fire telling the tribe what happened. And then you have someone who has Mid Journey and all--worldly artificial intelligence and can read your thoughts and senses. I think there is a book that is called Amplify. Everything can be strengthened, everything can be made wilder and you can invite more people. Yes, and that is also true. The tools to be creative are more accessible. But the geniuses are still rare. That's why we have a Leonardo Da Vinci, and you can't go beyond what he has done, the thoughts he has thought. So you can make an avatar that makes Leonardo Da Vinci's thoughts, but it's still Leonardo Da Vinci's thoughts. Or it's the same with AI today. When you make these pictures, where it looks like something, then you've still stolen it from some artists, who thought that the real thoughts first, are not created out of something. And what we are caught by, is what our eyes are holding on to. It's just that you've made a really nice picture of my mother, and it looks like Andy Warhol. And I could just press a button and it was Andy Warhol who was brilliant. And it's only because we have a love for his art that it arouses an interest in our hearts. It's the same with classical music. The first time you hear classical music, a song, it doesn't really arouse anything in you before you hear it a second or third time. something happens in it, where it makes sense. So we can't produce a lot of genius. We can produce an artistic version of it, but we always want to recognize when there are some small light-fades where you think, I would never have seen that coming. Because what becomes the original is to think what you think was original, not think. So I could also give you another dilemma. So now we are out there in 2050 and you know you can clone yourself so you can make an avatar. You have mega-traumas. Now you have two castles and a camping site, and I have to give you and go out and make sea turtles. Could you put a couple of avatars to something and then collect what they had made of yourself? It would simply be clones of yourself. Or would the soul be out, because you didn't have that awareness? Now you're asking Jim Lyngvild. I'm asking you. As a person, I'm not a personal assistant. I'm married to my husband Morten. We do everything together. He's my better half. That means I don't have anyone to do all the weird things of my creative work. I only have myself. Because I myself must always be the limitation of my creative performance. So therefore I don't need a workshop with 40 talented craftsmen, which are a lot of great Danish artists, and they have all kinds of talented people to make their things. And then they just write their names under and then it's called something. Damon Hirst for example. Olafur Eliasson. You can say all Bjørn Nørgaard. Everyone has the talent. And then it's their name that says, but it wasn't them who did it. And when it wasn't me who did it, I have done it before, done something with others, then it's Jim Lyngvild and Joachim Jensen, for example. Because it's extremely important for me to declare when I did it with my hands, with my thoughts, and when is it something that is done artificially? Or by others? So no, I would never do that. And then it would be awful, I would meet myself, I would kick myself out of the very, very high tower if I met someone who looked like me. So no, damn it, no more Jim Lyngvild on earth. Thank you for a really good answer. In the future, how do you think we should make friction? What kind of friction are we going to ask for? I can give you an example. I was supposed to be a member of a sauna, and I could only do that by camping in front of the sauna all night, and it pissed off, and it was really cold. There were 100 tickets to that sauna there were 100 tickets to that sauna Why did you go to that sauna? I didn't know that either but my girlfriend wanted us to go to the city and it was April and we went to that sauna but I've never been so happy for that winter bath membership and that evil sauna, because I have fought for it. I have been lying and freezing all night in the rain, where I got the last nail in my eye. You have done something for it. I am a very religious person and I believe in religion. Today you can say that you that you couldn't 22 years ago when I started and thought people made role-playing games was weird but I sacrifice a lot, I sacrifice gold, I sacrifice silver, I sacrifice great values and my mother once said to me why do you sacrifice those expensive things down in a mose, you don't get anything out of it I have two and a half castle and a husband I love and two dogs and you don't think I get anything. So it's about doing something and therefore always sacrifice something that will hurt. You can't just pick a little flower, I don't know, and now I sacrifice it because I want to be free of power. That's not how the world works, buddy. You have to bleed, you have to fight, you have to struggle, you have to destroy yourself to get out on the other side. We've always known that. What do you call it? Ad Astra, against the stars. You have to walk the extra mile to be really happy. Otherwise you get myself when I make a lecture where people almost don't pay anything to get me to do a lecture because I do it with a good heart. I know that well. When I go out there are no projects, no chairs, and when will you come? I didn't know that. But have they paid 55,000 for it? So there are projects that have chairs, all of them. And we are also used to inviting people out. Have you not done that yourself on your social media? No. So when people have not given anything for something, then it has no value. And it will never ever have. And that's super interesting, because when I look at this as a foreign researcher, I can just see that the convenience wave is rolling out of everything, from us getting up and cooking, to us talking to each other, but also making a voice message to each other. And that's because don'tscape is a huge mega trend. Yes, but it's also funny, because when Larsen mentions these things at the beginning, he also says 10%. What if the rest is 90%? They might not like to have a real view, or they're not have the courage to have a good view. So I always put 90% and not 10%. I also have to ask you, your mother doesn't think you should sacrifice gold and green trees in a mose. Where did you get the idea that things should hurt to do good? Who gave you that idea? No, I think it's just a voice in my head, so maybe I should go to a doctor about that. But I can see that when I do something. And my husband is from Holstebro, so he definitely doesn't believe in that. But there are times when he can get up and say, can't you just go out and do what you're doing? We need some help there or there. Then I can go out and do what I'm doing. Not everyone has it like that. Lars had it like that before we were doing the interview. I work from 6 am to 12 pm. Can't we just put 12 podcasts in a day? And then I was like, no Lars, I don't have the guts to do that. Yes, but when we talk about the future, what we're talking about now, there is a big trend for nudity,. Something you could also call feminization. But the fight and going through something where you are completely on your knees and then coming out on the other side and having succeeded in something is the greatest happiness in the world, perhaps after love. And it is now possible to live your whole life without ever taking any battles. You must be born in pain. Yes, you must be born in pain. And I think that is a very big source of disappointment. But many people say that we should remove all challenges. You don't need to have exams anymore. Everything should be so easy. And then people become very unhappy. There was a breakdown in the physical world. We came into a world where there was enough food and fast food and you didn't have to do anything physically. And then there are a lot of people and it becomes really unhealthy. Then we have taken a hold of it and now there is a wave of health and people are training and things like that. So many people find a way out of it, but many people don't find a way. And the same goes for this lacking mental state, where as soon as something is hard, you get rid of it. It's a huge problem, I think. And do you know what? Once there was a very smart man, his name was Charles Darwin, who said, that it's just a natural selection process from nature's side. The stupid hunter dies. That's how it is. No, they get artificial fertilization. Yes, or food. No, it's just that nature chooses the strongest individuals, who will always survive. That's how it is. The problem is that we always think that where we are in development right now is the highest. We have never been smarter. But I think so too, I think in 1740. I have a comment. Homo sapiens is said to be 300,000 years old. Stone age people had about 20% bigger brains than we have today. Interesting. Jim, now we are going out here and we are in 2050. Egmont is talking about bringing stories to life. What kind of wild stories do you imagine we have in the future? You say it comes in books. I just did an exhibition at Clausholm Castle, which ends tomorrow. We had 8300 visitors in three months, in a place that has never been open to the public before, about the royal family. You want to commit suicide when you hear the word royal family, it's so boring. But told properly, Frederik II himself can be interesting, as he was 500 years ago. So in 50 years, they will be the same thing. It's the same eternal things, we go around the way we have the world in the way we can. There are some big exhibitions around the world with Monet for example. There is not only one Monet painting, but there are projections of Monet and huge sunsets. And then you go around and feel Monet in this here. So you get the exhibition in a different way, because it's projected around you, into you, everything in your hands. It can be a very exciting way to learn about Monet, but it's still Monet you learn about, or Frederick II, or Michael Jackson, or whoever you think we should learn about at 50. So education, how does that look? So, artistic education, has it improved in 2050 because we now have some opportunities to experience that it is not just for the elite? Yes, I think so. I I think we are at a low point in the development of culture right now, where it is all about me, me, me. That's why Facebook is entitled to everything to be about you. It is so egocentric. The algorithms make it all about you or against you. Something you hate or something you love. Which both have something to do with you. So the moment we remove the algorithms and people start reading again, I didn't know I had to read something about a flood in Indonesia, and it just comes, then that's what gets interesting and not what's just being written down to your ego. And that's the next step for Zuckerberg and all of them, is to remove all algorithms and say, now it's free, now the game is free, now we're running completely. So it's random what's happening. So I think the counter reaction to all this is randomness. I also have another cat's nest in relation to this And that is not to make our fine Supertrend program, which is very technological heavy, into something bad. But it should be supplemented with art. And a lot of art today is about revenue and such a thing people who are in the government. Instead of it being an integrated part of our future, which is taken very seriously. If we look at the old writers, Riefbjerg and others, they were the ones who put the key to a welfare society where we made sure that no one fell completely to the bottom. And today it's like it's become a delusion that wasn't taken seriously. But I use a lot of film and books and art to get more colors and nuances in the future. But it's like it has been devalued. What's the point of getting it back? I think there are two reasons, or more reasons. One of them is that the word art and culture sounds like something from politics plus the earth segment, where you just want to commit suicide. Because it's so boring, and they are so boring, these people, they have their heads up in the air. And the art and culture elite, there are no one who wants to be part of the culture elite, because they are so boring, everything they say is so unseemly. And as long as the word culture is something where you get like, I get red dots and Köhler-type person in front of you, then I think we need to acknowledge that culture is a lot of things. My good friend Gitte Nørreby says that culture is blood vessels in every society, and that's what it is. It is blood vessels. It is the blood that runs through us, and then there can be technology that is bones and all these things around. So the culture or the experience will always change. And I think we have also become better at recognizing that big sport can also be culture. Culture can be many things. It's not to sit and listen to opera singer who's bragging about it in the royal theatres. It can be so much more. So it has to be a good investment? It has to be a good investment. You have to make money on art. I've never received a single krona in support for anything. And I laugh in bed every night. So I can make money on culture and I can still convince people. Then it might be that there are some professors who have a very long education and say, yes, it's the utilisation they're doing. Yes, but people go out of there, become smarter and then they might want to go home and learn something themselves. And that's the most important thing, to learn something for yourself. If you could give an example of some kind of experience friction, where would you invest it? I have actually brought a book with me, which I have almost just published, about Viking tattoos. And it's a whole book only about Viking tattoos, because that in itself is one thing There are people in all of Europe, when I started making this book 8 years ago, there were not many people with tattoos on their faces. I met one man who had one on his head, and I thought it was very much a limit. Even I am over-tattooed, also in my skull. And tattoos are... They can't do anything other than a ritual. You do something that hurts, you go through pain, a design process, you're in doubt, you think, I'm doing something that can never be fixed. You can go in and fix it, but why fix it?? So the idea of jumping out into something that is irreversible and that hurts and that is an experience. Tattooing is one of the most important things, and there are simply as many tattoo shops today as there have been before. Thank you very much for being here. According to the latest studies, the experience economy is growing in an unprecedented way. With 76% of all consumers who prefer to spend money on experiences rather than material goods. The term is about sensual experiences, escapistic experiences and enlightening and transformative experiences. And we can easily assume that the integration in this economy will be taken to new heights by 2050. Imagine a future where social media is experienced through a sensory interface, where the content is not just sound and images, but concrete feelings that can be experienced on your own body. Or a future where advanced technologies make you able to record and relive your dreams in a calm state, so you can build on good ideas or actively shorten your subconsciousness in collaboration with a therapist. Well, Lars, now you're going to talk about the investment perspective, the whole experience design economy. There must be some some democratization. You have been co-author of a book about it. I have read it and I have read other books about the experience economy and wrote about it. And it is like that, that it is a major part of the world's economy. But the experience economy will be a major part of the overall economy, and it does so because the AI and robots we've been working on will produce a lot of physical goods. And in the end, people think they have enough physically. You want better quality. But there is also something called ennphism. And I have at least one daughter who is completely uninterested in owning things. So her money is just in savings and hoops up, because she doesn't want to own anything. But she really wants to have culture and experience. And that's what she's interested in. And that wasn't so much in it, but there were a lot of measurements that show that it's not the new thing you've bought, whether it's a sofa or a kitchen. It's the experience, what you have in your body. It's also what your brain remembers, because everything disappears and the brain works on what is being repeated, but the disturbances are what are stuck in us. In happiness research, one of the many conclusions is that if people spend their money on buying experiences instead of buying things, they will get more success. Now you can say that there are certain things that give experiences, for example bass guitar, I think. But there is clear research behind it. So Lars, is it a nice to have trend, this experience industry, or is it a need to have? I can tell you about some societies where it doesn't fill that much. I mean it's a need to have, because you get some terrible, unlucky people if they don't have it. Is it a slow or fast trend compared to the past? Is it coming faster or slower? When we compare it with some of the technological trends we have talked about in other programs, I would call it a slow trend. But it is a very important trend. It is a culture that morphs from one state to another, with trends and against trends. I agree with you. Is it difficult or difficult to invest in something that gives people friction? Normally I use the toothbrush test, something you use twice a day. Is it something that makes life easier for people? Cool, so it's a good investment. But think now if we go the other way and say, now we have to invest in something that makes it harder but cooler. You can say, okay, you can invest in companies that make sports equipment, but it's not a special hot sector. Where there is really money made in the experience industry, it is in the luxury industry. And the world's richest man is called Arnaud, and his company does not make artificial intelligence or robots, they make leather bags and some things like that. And the last one, are you rich, sustainable, smart or well-mannered? Rich, not necessarily. There are many people who have become rich by working with the experience economy. Sustainable, I think it is neutral, but you get a better life, so in that way it is very important. I could really imagine that being smart was what came through, not entertaining, but actually that you become a smarter person, but on many fronts, both physically and mentally. Yes, there is a way to be clever, where two people are on vacation in Austria, and then it's a church with a lullaby, and one sees just a lullaby, and the other sees the whole history of Europe and the Ottomans and all the different cultural movements that make this a lie. And that clue creates success and helps you to make the right decisions. Is it a small trend, a medium trend or a super trend? It's a super trend.

Now it's really about getting technologies to complement each other. When we have the robots and the automation, we can program what we want and we can repeat. We have the same output every time. In Saudi Arabia we have already given a robot-Sofia-citizenship. We should have brought ourselves to a place where the, we have already given a robot-Sofia citizenship. We should have brought us all to a place where the creativity we have gives value to us all. Of course robots should not look like humans, they should be something completely different. This is Supertrends, the program where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, Earth to find out if it has once again become sustainable and can live off humans. It was the first time I had met a cute robot. Elon Musk thinks his robot company Optimus will be more changeable than Tesla. We need at least one employee. Welcome to an episode of the robots of the future. Lars, at our home we collect robots. We have so many of them and every time we are traveling we come home with a new one. How do you deal with robots? I have had some benches, well, not benches, but robots that remind me of benches. A few robots that run around and hit the grass in the garden, they work really well. And then some that vacuum clean inside the house, which works pretty well, I think. So I am on the bench-bed stage with robots, but I have a lively imagination, so I can imagine more. I've read a science fiction book, The Sun and Clara, which is fantastic, by this Japanese author. It's about a robot, and it's the first book I've read that's seen through the eyes of the robot. It's going home to Clara, who is terminally ill, and lives with her to comfort her, because she can't go to school because she's so ill. The neighbor's son is also thrown out of school, because he hasn't been lifted like the other children. They're all super intelligent. And those who insist on being an ecological child, they can't go to school with the others. An ecological child? Yes, who is not lifted up by intelligence. But the wild thing about this book is that it is worth reading. It is about copying the sick daughter so that the day she dies, the mother has a new child that can behave like the daughter. Yes, I take two of them. This robot ends up on the recycling station because there are always newer models. But I also think it's a bit hard, because you get connected to such a robot and add a lot of values and feelings along the way in the book. So it's also a bit special, how it becomes. And then I think more about a film like Blade Runner. Should we give them human rights? In Saudi Arabia, we have already given a robot a Sofia citizenship. So where do we see the future for the way we treat robots? We have a lot of predictions about that. I will say something before that. There is a movie called Artificial Intelligence, but as far as I remember it is about a robot that has feelings. It falls in love with a woman and in the end she ends up dead in a car. The robot is sitting on the front up in a car in the middle of the ocean. Dead. And that robot is just sitting on the front row, looking in, very in love. And I sat there and I was crying. It was so touching. I thought, they're good at Hollywood, it's just a robot robots and it's just a movie. But they had me. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, that in combination with artificial intelligence, gives a signal when future groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. We are doing that, and the examples we will take will range from the very practical and unusually common in everyday production in companies, for example, to what happens at home, and then some completely psychedelic things. So if we are to very practical companies, there are different automation systems. There is something called Customer Relationship Management Systems, CRM, and there is something called Robotic Process Automation, RPA, and then there is something called Enterprise Resource Management, ERP the predictions we have is about how these systems are integrated or rather how two of the systems integrate with the third namely Robotic Process Automation and that is actually that it is starting to become mainstream in 2024, which is almost now, that especially enterprise resource management systems, which control how a company uses all its resources, they directly talk to the systems that control the robots. If we can just describe something we want to have, then there is a network of systems that makes it produced. So it is a kind of magical future that is on its way. This is an example of some of the technology that can make it work. Now we are going to something more exotic, then we are going to 2027. It is the first AI controlled drone swarm, which is used in a military mission in the real world. It is of course an uncertain prognosis, because it is not certain that there is such a military mission anywhere in the world. We expected that there would be one in Taiwan in 2027. Then in 2028 we have drones that are stealth, that is, drones that can't really catch them, and then it becomes really effective. Then in 2028... Some Some people are quite wild, you see from Boston, where that dog is running around, and then there are some who have put some machine guns on their backs. It's quite unpleasant. Yes, I don't think so much about it, but that's just my opinion. I think it's the airborne, take the high ground, that's what's going on in the war. And therefore the flying drones. But in 2028, more than 50% of what is called full-time equivalent capacity, that is, production capacity in the rich countries is done by robot processing. So 2029, one more military, namely that we see the first battle on a battlefield between two opposing drone swarms. So thousands of swarms from each side that starts shooting each other down. So in 2030, the largest part of robot solutions are based on open software and hardware platforms. This is a trend we see in everything possible, also in artificial intelligence and so on. Open platforms tend to be most effective. Not always, but very often. So 2035, robots are used to make the first room habitat. That means, if you for example want to prepare to make a base on Mars or on Moon, then you first send some drones up and then they start with 3D printers. To build what you need to live in, but also to create fuel with some chemical processes. And I personally think that if there ever is a UFO in the cloud, which I don't think there will be, but you never say never, then I guess there is no biological life in it, so it's a bit of a mystery. 2038 we have a robot equipped with a cognitive ability called behavioural modelling, Which means that you have taken a robot that has human-like intelligence or better, and then it is able to read people's feelings and predict their actions, like most people are good at. So it ends with being lonely? Yes, or maybe it becomes a crush, what do I know? But now we are in pure science fiction. There are some robots around that can predict what we want to do and can really relate us. In 2040, more than half of the factories in the world will be automated with the help of AI and robot technology. Only half? It's the combination of AI and robot technology. AI has the ability to learn by itself. And at that point it would be really good at it. And before that, I forgot that we have, it's actually in 2025, so sorry I forgot that. We have self-propelled scientific laboratories. That means it's scientific laboratories, for example someone who develops medicine or other things, where the whole laboratory is a robot. And it is supported by artificial intelligence, which is able to interpret the results from experiments you make, and make new hypotheses and start new things. That means that you will have science laboratories that run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and just spit out knowledge. And that will accelerate our scientific discovery process significantly and also make our economic development.. The reason I want to go back to the 2025 is that in 2040 we have a prognosis that self-driving laboratories are beginning to create new life forms. I'm guessing it's bacteria for precision fermentation, for example. And then 2044, the last one we have, is self-propelled laboratories that are used to create superintelligence. There are many advantages in the future, where robot technologies are affecting our society even more than today, because they become much more sophisticated than those we know from the current industry. But one thing we will soon have to take a stand on is how far we can get them out with human feelings. That would make it much easier to build trust in the machines and thereby integrate them into our everyday life. On the other hand, we would suddenly have to relate to frustrated robots, robots that are intelligent, lonely or even depressed, shameful robots, disappointed and stressed robots and of course angry robots. Now I have two fantastic guests who will help us look into the future. We can start with the more concrete ones, because they represent companies and industries. Robots have been a permanent part of the inventory for a long time. It's you, Mie Harlsted. You are the CEO of AIM Robotics. Yes, hello. And then it's you, Anders Bilesø. You are on a line from Odense. You are Vice President at Universal Robots. Hi there. We'll start with you, Anders. What is a robot? Lars has talked about drones and running laboratories. Where does the line start and end? It's very interesting. because robots are a broad theme and there are actually many interpretations. So it's neither the first nor the last time you discuss what a robot is. I think in science, they talk about robots as machines that are able to measure something, sense something. They can think about it, plan it, and then they can act on the background of it. And then you often think of some form of physical action, but as Lars said in the intro, then you also talk about robotic process automation, which is actually more of these software robots, which also in some way measure something, think a little about it and act. But what is the difference between robot technology differs from clean software technology. But Anders, what are the biggest limitations in relation to getting people and robots to interact closely with each other? That's where we have to go before we can close the door in our house. Yes, it is a lot. And you are of course on the central topics, such as safety. Safety means, especially when you work with machines, it means a lot. But it is also about being in areas where we have solutions, where we understand what needs to be done. Technologically, modern robots, what we call collaborative robots, can control themselves, just like us humans, so that we don't exert more force than is dangerous, so that you can make sure that people don't get hurt. And then there is a huge impact on the sensor technology, which also makes it possible to make sure that robots don't hit each other with sharp objects. No matter what, robots can do dangerous things, no matter how blind you are. If you first handle a barber blade or a razor, you will probably not be close to people. But I would say that there is a huge progress. So this parallel between humans and robots is also about interaction. It is also about... One thing is to imagine that you fully automate everything. And that was also where we were in the industry 10, 20 or 30 years ago. Now we have reached the realization that it is difficult to create this parallel. How do we use the creativity and intelligence that people can have in the interaction with technology? And it is probably in this area that there will be a big step forward, where AI will move the boundaries for what it can do. And what is it that makes Denmark, in terms of robot development, relatively good? Lars and I have just been to a startup with funding and so on. Everyone talked about Odense being able to do something very special. is it that is needed to achieve something? We are such a small country, globally speaking, because it is also spreading to other places. It is very interesting that Denmark, and especially Odense, has materialized over the last decade as a very central hub. People are looking at it as one of the few places in the world where robot technology is growing so strongly and has commercial success as a hotspot. I think what we really can do is that we have actually managed to find the formula for how to get the pragmatic input into this, which is very high-tech. As Danes, we have a little bit of a pragmatic approach to it. If you compare with Silicon Valley startups, where the money is hanging on the trees, but where there are also very high ambitions to be very disruptive. And you can do that when it's software. But when you work with robot technology, where you also have to have hardware with, where you really have to understand all the details of what is going to happen in the physical world, and make advanced software, and think about the little traumatic needs that users have. That's what we're really good at in Denmark. We're really good at understanding something that is technological, but also getting to up with some pragmatic, a bit Nordic designed thoughts about how this should contribute to value out there. And in 2050, how do you expect the technology within AI automation to develop? I think there there has been a big change in the way we experience technology and its proximity to what we do today. But what is interesting, now we start talking about science fiction and how the world plays out so rarely. We often experience, if you look back to the future, flying cars around now. And self-drying jackets. Exactly. We don't have all of that. In fact, no one could imagine smartphones and AI at the level we experience it today. So what we will experience until 2050 is technology that moves us into our lives in a way that we... Well, maybe it's not that far from it, these quantum jumps in relation to cars starting to fly us out, will not happen. But what will happen is that we will experience more automated things in our kitchens. We will experience much more automated things in our production, in factories and so on. We will also experience that far more services can put things together, decide and be involved in handling things. So we will to a great extent be behind the pizza in the future. Anders, one thing I wonder about, because we have had all these tech from OpenAI and others who have said that you should press the stop button and now it's dangerous. And where it's running very cold down the back, it's just with robots, as Lars is talking about, that if they can become self-creating and self-thinking and take initiative and they suddenly also have a physical body, and that's really what we get at the moment. We have a flood of driverlessless cars. If you can hack it or if you can take over something physical, then what do you think about it? Is it really worth worrying about it? Because we can't really stop the development. We could do that with human cloning, we could do that with nuclear bombs, there are people who can give each other their hand. But here there are so many people to build robots, that's the way we're going. That's right. And we shouldn't stop this development, we have to find a way to handle it, like so many other things. We have to channel the development the right way forward. But I would also say that there are some steps that are much longer than others. We can also see, for example with driverless cars, that what they have been good at is actually talking about this linear journey towards fully driverless cars. You talk about these levels of automation, where you have started by saying, well, let's just let it stay in the lanes, let it follow the car in front of it. Because that's actually some of the steps we can take. And there are quite a few steps up the ladder of innovation before we have a robot that walks around in our kitchen and saves the bed for us and cooking the food and so on. But there will be a lot of steps on the way there. So I think if we manage how we interact with this, we will experience many of the things we spend a lot of time on today. And that is, for example, writing long, well-published documents that you can now pull out of ChatGPT, and so on. We will also experience that many of these things, where we actually repeat something that is done in advance somewhere in the world, we will in greater degree automate.. So it's a super effective, says something that not everyone knows what it is, but copy machines. But physically, we're talking about black restaurants down in the basement where the food is produced by robots and then transported up by an elevator. Because that can copy the previous cook's work. Is it that full automation? Is there also an economy in it to get it out everywhere? Or as soon as we have some machines, they are also expensive to keep. Now we are talking about windmills and all sorts of things, but they don't last forever. No, but what we are experiencing right now is that technology is becoming much more accessible. I think I work daily with 8-9 start-ups that are making small robot-based restaurants that you can go out and get to stand in a corner. For example, if you have a large company that is far from the canteen, then you can just have a small robot restaurant in the corner that can prepare a menu you just order on your app and then it will be delivered. We also see companies today where we build robot solutions to sweep the walls so the master painter can light the robot, it sweeps the whole new room and then they can start painting because it is a time-consuming, heavy process. And here's what I have to process. Can you stand in the room while the robot is in motion, or is it too dangerous? Of course you can. But you don't risk sparing the rucksacks? You can, but you're less likely to spare a lot less dangerous than that. We've learned that the technologies that are supposed to coexist with the robots, we are actually very good at controlling. So now it's like taking these processes one at a time and find out how we can really help. And we have to remember that it is difficult to find people and it becomes more and more difficult to find people who both want to and can do all these things. We should all have brought ourselves to a place where the creativity and flexibility we have really gives value to all of us. We are also in a situation where the geopolitics is up in the. Earlier, we could easily send things to other countries. Could you see the future of robots as one where it becomes profitable to get it home to ourselves and to where things should be delivered. You can believe that. There is a problem with the lack of labour across the world. Even low-income countries. And the more of these repetitive processes we make automatizable, the easier it is to get it home and get it done close to where we need it, where we don't have to transport it all over the world, where we don't need to use oil for that. And it really gives us the flexibility that Lars is also talking about, where we need more personalized products, where we can't expect all subcomponents to be sent across the world. It also gives us much more, one could say, robustness in supply chains, Elon Musk says that we get this personal robot at home. At the same time, I have seen your work with and developing robots. It is not going exponentially as we see with software and hardware. It just runs a bit slower. Will it suddenly accelerate? Or is it a nice linear development we see when we talk about physical robots? You talked about the levels of autonomous cars. Or can there suddenly be a tipping point that makes it all explode? I think you should look at it on the same route as driverless cars. We have to take some steps and say that a humanoid robot that runs around in the kitchen and makes things for us, it's a long journey. It is very difficult to get both hardware and software, because robot technology is a symphony of both, to really move the boundaries for us. But I think that in return we will see innovation that we have not expected in all sorts of other places where the things we already have become more intelligent, become even more efficient, will be developed when new products are introduced, which may not necessarily be this magical product that does everything we could imagine, but in reality has much more intelligence in the things they do. I think that in a few years I will run around with a personal AI that guides me through life and that it is also aware that guests are coming and that there are things to do in that connection. Can you, based on all the experience you have with robots, take us into the home and say which things such home robots could easily do and which things are really, really tricky to get them to find out? Yes, and you hit it exactly because Lars, you also experience that technology is melting together. We see a lot of what is happening in our calendars. It is found as data today. So to bring it into many different machines and processes in the house. So it is certainly already today that we will switching to a cozy lighting when guests arrive. And we will experience it for example with kitchen processes. Food making is a process that is already being automated on a business scale to make robot kitchens. There have already been different pilots to make high-end automated kitchens. The washing machine is also a place where it is difficult today because the clothes look very different. So the washing machine is handling it, but it starts to break down some of the barriers. Because that's what's been difficult for us. It has been to be able to separate between the things that are just dead natural for us. So it's those sensors and now it's Mia Haraldstedt, CEO of AIM Robotics. She's now jumping up and down. Yes, I'm jumping down, but it's more because of the comparison with robots. As Lars mentioned, what I noticed was that you really wanted the robot to be an extension of you. And not necessarily a machine that was programmed and told about to do anything. So it should be a part of you in your calendar and be your extra you. It knows what I want. It knows what you want and takes everything boring. And that's interesting because there are many boring things that are going to happen and we don't want that to happen. So this expectation from the user with the robot, I think is more interesting than the task it should actually solve. Because the expectations are much higher than what people can possibly get a robot to do at some point, since they are not quite sure they can get a consciousness.. But I think it raises the question of what a machine can do, what a robot can do, and should it be your supervisor who lives in the house and actually takes care of all the boring stuff? It's a very bad way to look at it, that we are always comparing people and robots. That's where the problem is. I was at Novo Nordisk and they have made a fully automated factory. There is almost no human on the floor. I thought, what should people do? They should wonder about all the input files that still need to be printed and put in the boxes, when there are no more of those poor patients who want to read them and we also have a climate view. How do you see this robot development and climate and businesses and can we get so much automation that we actually forget to think about improvements? No, I don't think so. Because I think you got it right. And again, if we think back to science fiction, so using robots in movies is actually a really good way to light up some ethical dilemmas. And it's often where we end up with our intuitive fear of the automated personality. And where we often see things moving, it's actually to give us even better tools. So it's processes that are possible today that we should have used our time on before. And Mie said it very well, everything that is actually boring, we need better tools for that. But what we often imagine is an automation of myself, instead of saying how our tools get better and better. Anders, I think you gave the cue that I want to have Mi more on the field. Because you started AIM Robotics. Tell us what that technology is all about. We focus on plug and play dispensing. It's really about putting a hand on the tool arm that Universal Robots makes. Making a solution for the customers that can make a simpler production setup. That's what Odense and Denmark can do, which we were also working on a little earlier. And it's this network to deliver a solution instead of small, half tools. How did you get to that? Yes, that's a bit of a longer story, but it was in fact because it was something in the world. There were no dispensing solutions. What is a dispensing? Even more specific. A dispensing is for example a gun on a robot arm. But it is to deliver some liquid mass in a production line to a gun mass or to electronics. So it's you who sparkles? Yes, we could do that. Sparting out on the wall. Okay, I feel like it can be used to mix cocktails, maybe. It must be next time, for sure. If we unquestionably continue the development and implementation of robots in society, we we will naturally enter into unforeseen ethical problems. Especially if the artificial intelligence of robots begins to match the human level of consciousness. Then one day it will happen that there will be a demand for citizen rights for robots. But how advanced should a robot be to get rights? Okay, what do you see the potential of Størst for Roboter? If you were to invest in new projects, now we've talked a bit about the home, but where do you look and think, now you've already started one company based on something that's missing. Where is something missing? I can imagine that people really need it. I can see that in my parents and the older generation. I can also feel that I am starting to get there myself, because things are going so fast. But all this you can't understand, comes out very quickly, so you can better navigate it. I think there is a need for some AI and a robot to help at levels where you can't even translate it into a robot, or you're catching your father by having a very good chat with ChatGPT without knowing it. So, skeletons, it's a kind of robot you're catching your father by having a very good chat with the chat-capitae without knowing it. So, skeletons are a kind of robot you're using that makes you stronger. We've already seen that pilgrims, elders and people, they simply use them to climb mountains and all sorts of things. At least for that generation. Why do you think that the so-called robots in Asia and in the Nordic countries are much more scary? Well, they are more than able in some way. And they help you to experience some things that you may not have time for or advice for or can do in other ways. And And in that way it's really, really exciting. And then there's also this understanding of electronics that might be different here in the north, where in Asia, now I found out in the past, I have a family member, his business is simply to take care of people's virtual pets when they're on vacation. And that took me a moment to think about it, because how can it ever make sense? But that means that there are some people who really, really love their little robot dog, which is virtual and they can't even touch it. So now we're talking about that we get robotic pets, or they already exist. Well, they are completely their own. When you think about how much we use physical mammals, then it is of course a industry. You probably wouldn't want to sit with your pure Arcus Universal robots, or what do you think Anders? Is it a industry you are involved in? Yes, there are a lot many industries. We haven't thrown away the carnivorous animals yet, but there are many species. As you say, the big difference between the Asian and our Nordic cultures. It's actually the whole understanding of technology as a participant. It's actually very central to Asian culture to be technology fascinated, to be curious about technology. If you watch a cartoon for children, you will find a positive spin on the technology that gives humanity superpowers. In Western history, we have a more dystopian approach to technology. And it also makes our ability to adapt to it a little more negative. Could you imagine that it will be better now, where we have, for example, got the large language models, the chat, GPT and all sorts of others. Lars was a bit on it before. Suddenly you can sit and jam and maybe also get someone who develops robots on the other end. Could we imagine getting a little more democratization? Because right now it is a head office and you have been bound that AIM Robotics is going forward in finding someone who will deliver the rest of the body. That's also a barrier to get started, right? Yes, exactly. They all speak their own language. And that's where if now everyone speaks the same language, then life will of course be much easier and the possibilities would be much greater. So an open source robot platform? What are we talking about here? I'm sure we see it in so many industries now that the technologies are melting. I don't think so, because there have been many attempts to standardize everything. We haven't seen it work anywhere in the world. Android is perhaps the best example. But what we learn is to get technologies to talk. Now you can buy light bulbs from Philips in your smart home, you can buy radiation sensors from Danfoss, you can buy everything and you can actually get them all to talk together. So when you step out the door, it lights up for you and it also turns on the heat and so on. So we learn to do this interoperability and AI can really get in when we can get all these smart units to talk together. And I don't think that the solution is standardization where you take the differentiation out of the different unique products But it's more about lifting up the differentiation, so that when something new comes on the market, it can play even better with something else. But it's certain that single technologies, like they did 10, 15 or 20 years ago, where single technologies were more focused on protecting it, that time is long gone. Now it is really about getting technologies to complement each other. Back to Lars' analogy about coming home, having guests. How do you get all the technology to play together to make the reality clear to us? I was also just caught up in the fact that this thing with input and things to play together. Now I'm also trying to get light and music to play high when I step out of the door just to get that experience. But it still requires that I have five apps, two phones, Wi-Fi and everything running. And then it has to be good to be outside if it's playing. But I also think there is this period we're just going through, which I also had with Siri. She was hard to talk to at the beginning and now we're actually really good friends. Now we can figure it out. But it took a long time before she was really good. And I think that's what all the other technologies need to do to learn and give the right input to get the output we really want to have. What do you think, Lars? I wrote a book in 2014 called The Creative Society, and I came to the conclusion that there were a few factors that needed to be there at once to create innovation in society, and one of them was open standards. And there are many of them. In antiquity, amphorae were called a standard measuring units. So people were able to talk about how much they sold to each other. But open standards for technology are extremely innovative in the way that they get things to play together. Then we have people like Apple, who are creating an ecosystem that is quite closed, but where they are creating what is called APIs, which means that millions of apps can run on their platform, etc. So it is also very important for the robot industry to really bloom, I think. I have just made another comment to what we talked about. How can it be that Asians are so technologically positive compared to Europeans? You have to say that Americans are also more technologically positive on average than Europeans. And this has actually deepened me a bit at point, because I found it interesting. So there is an old Germanic cultural movement called Sturm und Drang. And it was later called Romantikken and it was later called Blut und Boden. It was under the Nazis, so it was a very raw edition. But we also had an out group called Amish, for example, who are these anti-technological movement cultures in the USA. So it is a very old, Germanic cultural trend that is more dominant in Europe than it is in other parts of the world. So there are very, very long lines back in time. What are you most curious about, Lars, in relation to the 2050 of these robots? I think it's relatively easy to see what robots will be able to do. I'm very much in doubt about how fast it will go, because sometimes, you've actually been in on that now in our chat slot, that sometimes, all of a sudden, there's a breakthrough, and breakthrough and something explodes. I think of course of home robots, for example home robots where you can get 3D printed parts of them could be something that makes it explode. But we have not seen an exponential growth in the use of industrial robots. We haven't seen a phase change where it's completely gone. And I'm very interested in whether we will see that. Are we doing that, Anders? Yes or no? And why not? The fastest is probably no. In any case, so far we have't seen the technologies that are supposed to make the phase change, especially on the physical side. We are still mechatronically very far from what humans can do. On the AI level, it's only single building blocks. There is a long way to human cognition. We are in the same place with the mechatronics. I would like to add something, and that has something to do with your invention. We are in a violent climate crisis, and I could imagine that something that accelerated this development was precisely the precision economy, that you don't waste a lot of resources, that you can use exactly what you need, whether it's fertilizer in the farm or in the dispensers. Can you talk a little bit about how robots play with the climate we have to deal with? Yes, NetUp is actually really good, because when we have the robots and we have the automation, we can program what we want and we can repeat, we have the same output every time. When we can do it, we know how much, in my case, how much lime has been dispensed and on which units it has been dispensed on. So we have this data and we can follow the thread all the way through. I think in the future, at a current time, it would be fantastic if we knew how much volume there is every time. So we only buy it in, we use what needs to be used and we don't use it anymore. But at the same time, we can also find this data in the future and build the future. And in reality, we can also follow it through cradle to grave on every single product. So we know exactly how much energy and how much material has been used. Yes, and if there is variation and then in real time can change dosage and so on. Yes, absolutely. Keep an eye on it all. What is the climate argumentation with you, Anders? Do you think that could be an accelerator? Absolutely. One can say that both the technologies of the future and the future are getting smaller. You talked about about the big production lines we had in the factories earlier, are very, very cost-effective, both in energy and unfortunately they are very little flexible. So when we come to this modern future where products change, maybe not even on a 10-year basis, but on a yearly basis, on a monthly basis, then there is simply so much cost in both rebuilding huge resource-spending and supply chain problems. So as we go towards things that are much simpler, much more accessible and which is actually more flexible. If you compare it with the energy demand in traditional factory technologies and then just in relation to where we are today with modern production technology, then we are perhaps a 100 below today. It's interesting because it plays into a topic that we hear about again and again, and that is this mass individualization, where each consumer or each customer wants to have something completely individual. For example, you can go on a website if you know certain types of cars. You design your car on a website and the robot can find it without any other difficulty and make one that is similar to me. As it expands more and more, you also get these flash products, where a company finds an influencer who launches a product and the product is only available for 30 days and the robots can do it and then switch to something else. Robot technology really supports this underlying process in society, where everything is individualized for each person or customer. Something we are currently working on, or rather working on, is office communities. I can't help but think about these machines, they are expensive to make. But could you make a kind of access economy, like some mega-businesses, where you come to Odense and then you can actually produce one thing or the other. Are we all going to invest in the deep plate, or could we we imagine new business models or ways to get things to work? So there are some business models, sorry Anders, but where exactly do new things come in? Just like Lars was saying, we think a thought, we want someone to. And we shouldn't just talk about 3D modeling or the tools themselves. We should think about the idea and describe it enough that someone will make it for us. And we will make it in Denmark. So it's cloud robotics, you could call it. There is a cloud of robots that you you can mobilize them to solve a problem for one, and then you are out of there again. What do you think, Anders? I agree. We see that there is a lot of production that is becoming contact production. And we will see that trend move down to the barrier of entry, as it is called. Back to Lars' example of the influencer who can get a production established, maybe not by himself, but by someone who wants to help in the course of a very short time. So it will certainly change the entire limit of what needs to be invested. So I think we will see two trends, both this swarm of robots, the digital economy, where you have the production we can share, but we also want to see technology come in in much more competent technologies. Not only 3D printing, but combining 3D printing with robot technology, so it can also take the things you print out and put them together. It can also do that in a scale that private companies can participate in. Do you think that you can be the one to start over again in 2050 and it will be much easier this time to start a new company? And has the robot concept become smaller at that time? Because right now I now it covers a lot of things. AI, robots, automation. There is no one who is completely sure where it is. Where does it start and where does it end? Has the term become smaller? It should be. There should be a difference. If we think that they have a conscience and there are people who help us at home, then there are others who are machines and who are the stupid ones who are doing something. Those who are programmed, now I call them stupid, but it is those who are programmed, they must have input all the time. And then there are those who are our, now I call them fellow friends, those who take care of us. So there should be more terms, depending on what this one robot should be able to do. Let's say that we have these two types of robots that you are talking about. One that thinks and is your servant, and one that is just a stupid machine in the eyes of the good. Should we then be forced to put eyes and ears and in the whole dress these self-thinking bots up so that we have respect for them as humans? What does it require in relation to how they should be designed that we give them so much intelligence? That's a really good question, because it has actually been something that we have experimented with a lot over the last year or two. And we have actually all learned that where we work best with the technologies is to see them as better tools, better things to work with. So all the robots that have been made with this physical presentation, it actually distances us from them. Because either we think they are completely useless, because they look like our friends, or they are actually a little bit strange, almost unpleasant to look at. So I think where we as humans are best at accepting and working with new technology is actually to see them as even smarter tools. Even Siri, which we use and have a good dialogue with, we still see it as a machine tool. And our children, even if they have an interaction with it, ask them to tell a secret, etc., then you still see it as something that can remember to set an alarm when the eggs are ready. I think that is a fantastic way to end this, Anders. We need to make these intelligent bots more machine-like. And away from the naive, where we always talk about how like humans, and give them permission to be the tools they are. Thank you very much, and thank you very much to you, Mi. You're welcome. As technology fills more in our everyday life, robots and artificial intelligence suddenly appear in. In religion. There are already robot priests in several countries, for example in Japan, India and Germany. And there are spiraling currents within techno-spirituality, where religious practice and advanced technology go up in a higher unit. So imagine a future in 2050, where meditation and worship are supported and maybe even reinforced by robots. In religious rooms, in people's homes and in virtual environments, where act as spiritual guides who guide and adapt the faith to the individual needs. What do you think about this program, Lars? Lise Lotte is trying to become a robot. I think it's super exciting and there are a lot of things going on in my head. And I also think the last remark was interesting about that, which relates to that we should not believe that when we do something new, it is the same in a new way and then it. And that it would be something else. And we have had that in all kinds of technologies. When the radio came out, people thought it was reading from books in a new way, so people could listen to it from books. And then we found out that it was something completely different. And of course robots should not look like humans, they should be something completely different. There are also some very exciting price deviations, because as soon as something can be automated, the price falls completely. So the one product after the other goes from being very expensive to suddenly becoming extremely cheap. But Lasse, I can't help but think that software is cheap, you could say. It's bits and bytes. And the reason it's going a bit slow with these robots is that they're quite expensive. It's mega expensive to get a car. It has to be built, it has to be made. So we're not the cheap workforce in the future. If you can produce, it requires raw materials, we have climate challenges, CO2 emissions and all sorts of things. If you just say we have to make coal in the work and then all the high technological things together, then we are over to artificial intelligence and machines. I know a former director of Sulzer, a very large Swiss engineering company. He once told me that when you double the annual production of a product, the price drops by 7%, and if you keep doing it, it becomes very cheap. And then He gave me an example, he said diesel engines are crazy, completely psychedelic cheap to produce, even though they have a lot of moving parts and look complex. And it's just because so many of them are made and you've done it for so long. So what will happen is that you will get some breakthroughs where there really, really will be a lot of robots produced and then their price will fall completely. But it will change our economy and contribute to solving a lot of problems that otherwise would be. Are robots nice or need to have? Without robots we would run into major national economic problems and they contribute already today to our living standards being significantly higher than otherwise would be. So it's need to have. Slowly or fast? It's not as fast as many of the other things we talk about. I would say slowly is also what we hear from our guests. Is it difficult or complicated to invest in? There are a lot of companies you can invest in, both those who make it and those who use it. Can you tell us a little about what we should mark them with? Typically, you have repetitive tasks, which are identical transactions made on a large scale and which can be solved with robots. Rich, durable, smart or fast? Rich, durable, smart but not so fast. Is it a supertrend? It's a supertrend. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends. If you have comments, questions or suggestions, you can write to us on social media.

This is Supertrends, the program where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is a future researcher at Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator to build up your brand, review and pass the test. 77% of consumers regularly take reviews when they plan to buy. 75% say that reading a positive review is the most important factor that makes them feel good about the company. This time it is about rating economy or recommendation economy. We have guest philosopher and professor Vincent Hendrix with us to give his advice on whether 2050 will offer more or less. Welcome. Lars, I think that the recommendation economy has some fantastic opportunities. If you are sitting and are a rich Indian somewhere, you have never had a credit history, you have never had a credit card, then suddenly you can come into this share economy and get some good recommendations because you can be trusted, you may be lending some goods or you have rented a apartment on Airbnb and then this good renommee gives you the opportunity to get a loan. So we have some completely new types coming in and get a chance in society. There is a guy who is polite, he is persuasive, he keeps his promises. So these judges are extremely rich. Yes, I agree. And if you want to say something positive about the rating economy, then I think in many ways it is civilizing in the way that it brings us to and makes us better. And I will give such a completely flat example from everyone's everyday life, but as you best understand if you are a little older. So when I was younger, when I traveled around, for example, I could easily find some totally absurd, bad restaurants. And that's called tourist traps, and I think that's extremely rare today. And that's because they're just rated the same, and no one comes along with it. So people behave much better, I think, when there are rating services. There is a small problem, and that is that 15% of all these recommendations are totally fake. We have had cases where a restaurant that didn't exist got a lot of votes. And they just did that to show that it could be done. There are some things to keep an eye on, Lars. So if it's some mega positive reviews, but that doesn't give details, then it's a sign that people are lying. But it can also be a typo and bad language. And then there's also this LMM, Large Language Modeling, which are really good at making reviews. They just get better and better at faking. You have to look at the review subscriber of this review and then you have to see where they have registered and if they have registered all possible places within a short time in the whole world, then you can well assume that they are not there at all. They are sitting at home and enjoying themselves. But can you remember that we have talked a lot about these personal AI for a long time and I can't help but think about when we look at 2050, they will put all these ads out there, that my AI talks to your AI about that it would be good to buy a pair of pants for you, Lars. Or whatever it could be. That Does the whole review economy move to a new place? I think it moves both the strength of brands and the strength of... The strength of doing things properly and that it will change and is in the process of changing a lot of behavior patterns in how we how we buy, trade and decide. You can say it's power and money, so where they move, the big tech giants also move and try to get as much influence as possible. Shall we take a tour in the timeline? We do. Supertransmask Machine is a dynamic timeline built by world-leading experts, that in combination with artificial intelligence gives a clue to when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. Yes, it does. In the past, when I've been in this time machine, I've only talked about the future. But it actually goes back in time, where it tells about what has happened within all the different subjects we have. I'm going to do that in this episode, just to remind us how much rating there really is in our society. So in 1951, something called something called Nielsen ratings, Nielsen Media Research, which is now a huge media research company that makes TV ratings. Then we know Michelin Guide and Michelin ratings for restaurants. It came in 1955. In 1965, there was a big so-called MPAA film rating system. Then there was Billboard music ratings, the first among many. So those who are wine enthusiasts may know Parker's Wine Guide. It came in 1976. And then there came one after the other after the third. Some of them were quite exotic. For example in 1999, Raid My Professors came out. You made a rating yourself on journalists? Yes, I did. I made one called Raidjournalist.com, because I got mad at a journalist. It was quite complicated, but I got it all set up. I wanted to get all the journalist's attention for the rest of my life. I didn't want to use my experience, so I didn't go further with it. But it's all clear. If anyone wants to fight with journalists for the rest of their lives, then they just have to write to me. Then there is something like social media, like buttons are a huge thing and we actually rate each other's content all the time. Then there is a two-way rating system. Uber is fantastic in the way that the driver rates the driver rates the customer, the driver and the entire experience. And now you say Uber, I would like to say that they have made a new approach where they have certified drivers who can take children under 18 years old, where they are especially child-friendly and cleared and all that. I think that's smart, because they are driving alone with all kinds of stuff. When you buy online, eBay, Amazon and so on, you can also rate where you buy from. Rate products, rate their... They have all the small stores in the store, then you can rate the shipping and so on. And they have also made a system to verify that you actually bought it. So there will be no false ratings. But then we go into the future and there are a lot of progn that. One of them is that with wearables, like for example health trackers, shoes and jewelry and so on, people can make an instant rating right there because they have the experience and then they go in and do it. I don't know if it's that different from doing it on your mobile phone, which is normally handy. And then there are different prognoses for if you can do a rating based on biofeedback, that is, there is something that observes your pupils, heart rate and so on, and then it looks like you like it or not. then it automatically creates a rating system for it. It gives a lot more meaning because the fact that you get such a rating thing when you have been to a hotel three weeks after, it depends on what mood you are in there. But because rating is so important for how well the business is doing, there is a prognosis that it will be expanded to get virtual rating consultants. That is to say consultants who simply advise one on how to manage rating of their business. We have talked a lot in these programs about the coming of personal AI. Before the next few years, it might become a really big AI program that helps you through your life as a coach, as a study guide, as an organizer, as a psychologist, etc. And these personal AIs will tell you all about yourself. You can imagine that the personal AI helps you to rate and then rates for you based on your own performance. For example, if you have a job interview, you just hit the button and it says, I rate. The AI rates this job candidate and then tells why. There is also a prognosis for AI that rates a meeting. So you have a meeting on Zoom or a physical meeting and then afterwards there is a rating about how good this meeting was in relation to, for example, how good was this meeting in terms of reaching concrete decisions and giving enough room for people to talk. Then there is a digital footprint authenticity rating. It is quite psychedelic. It is an automatic system system that rates what people say on social media. For example, if you fly to a climate summit in a private plane or something else, then the rating says there is a mismatch between what you do and what you say. And then we have 2028, an anti-troll rating system. So there are trolls out there who systematically with bad intentions and rate wrong. And there can be a system that rates the ratings and then says that these ratings are simply not serious. And in 2028 also, when this metaverse is probably starting to get big and you have virtual persons there, then they can also be rated as such. And then there is that you can rate circumstances when they happen. In political discussion, for example, you can sit and rate in real time. And then you can have some speedometers that say how good or bad you can like them. I would say I actually have... It would be interesting to have such a thing that you are running votes on the politicians. There is nothing about the election, it runs as an organic process. I have seen a little of it, but there are many ways to do it. You can do it in all kinds of sports. the last thing I want to take is, it's actually in 2026, is that you can well set your personal AI to rate how much you grow as a person, for example. And that means, it says you're behind because you've set a number of goals for your life this year and you are 12% behind right now. So rate yourself or your AI rates you. If you are in a situation where your company has received a negative or decidedly false review, especially on Google, it can be a challenging process to do something about it. But there is still advice. The first advice is that you should answer friendly and professionally on the application to talk about your case and show other customers that you take feedback seriously. The second advice is that you can report the application to Google. If it exceeds Google's guidelines and you can explain why it does so, there are good chances that the report will be removed. And the last advice is to minimize the effect of the bad report by encouraging satisfied customers to leave positive reports that bagatelize the negative. Vincent Hendrix, welcome. You are a professor of philosophy at the University of Copenhagen. You have also written a long series of books and you are a recipient of the Rosenkær Prize. I can remember, and you are the head of the Center for Information and Bubble Studies. How many followers do you have on Facebook? I don't have any profiles on social media platforms. I have no intention of being a big tech whore. I just think it was an incredibly interesting introduction to your persona, because you can live without it. But for most of us, especially the young people who are going out to the job market, they know that the employers are googling you and trying to see what's written on the paper. Is it the right profile? So it means something. If you are not there, you don't think it's a cool Vincent. It's probably someone who has been in prison. I could have been, even if I didn't have a profile in the platform. That's right. I was recently exposed to a virtual assassin. It was because they had made a future series on Netflix, which I spent a lot of time on during Corona, to make input to, and I was recorded and everything. So they found an American who has spiked it all. And I think that was fine, but I got a little angry that they hadn't written my name. And then I complained, and I wrote to them, and I also wrote to the social media, that they might have just considered the subtitles. The next thing that happened, I had planned to get a sweet we-replies letter back, was that they attacked me. They gave me one star on Google and my company and said that I sold goods that were not found. I don't have any goods, so I can't do that. But it was really unpleasant. And then I wrote to them and then I said, we just wrote back, we hope that you have now understood that you should not make us be at peace. And it was really wild. I know another, a Masked Deezer, who cried for 14 days because he had had a customer who wrote horrible things about him. It can really get into a central nervous system. and people can sit anywhere from under covers with fake profiles. It's not someone you meet properly. There is a reason why young girls are being mistreated. It is that troll bullying that also occurs. So on the one hand we are deeply dependent on some form of registration economy. We would like to avoid bad restaurants, as Lars was talking about. But what then? But you also sell something. You say you don't sell any products. Yes, you do. You sell yourself, you sell your brand and you sell your data. And that means that everything that can be digitized, will be digitized. And everything that can be digitized, is data. And all data is credit data. About you. About me. About Lars. About services. About services. About everything. You just have to remember that I just passed one of those big stores that sells electric cars. Right around the corner. No mention, no forget. And it looked very reliable, that car. It was then sold to a company in the east. And besides being a car you can drive around in, it's also a data trawler, which is one of all data about the car, about the people in the car, where they are going, where they are going to buy in, and sometimes they scream in the backseat because they can't get the last new app, etc. All of that transmits us back to, in this case, China. It could also have been the same in the USA. Why? Because data is everything. In this information economy we live in, data is simply the new gold. It is better, it is the most potent economy we have ever made. I think Susanne Asuboff says that very well in her book, Overvågningskapitalisme. We as humans have always capitalized and cannibalized on something. We started as jagers and collectors, then we got a day of use, then we got a feudal society, then we got industrialization, and here in the 2100s we looked around and said, let's see what we can fuck with next. And then we looked at the mirror and said, what about ourselves? Now we take the cognitive resource that is most important to us, namely our attention, and then we turn it into capital asset number one. And what we use it for is to predict our behavior, modify our behavior, with the aim of selling ads to each other. That's how far we've come in the back of the Enlightenment period. Because the Enlightenment thinkers, for example, were Rousseau, Montesquieu and the rest, they deeply introduced enlightenment and information with the aim of autonomy and collective democracy. And what we found out in the information session was, let's try to sell ads to each other and predict each other's behavior. With regard to making some huge data-draws, so that we have a really good idea of, personalized, who we are, what we like and why. And then we sell ads and predict our advert. And then it's not enough. Then we can think that wisdom of crowds works. That's what Lars says, and I think he's right. The assumption of wisdom of crowds, as Josef Schiff told us already in 2004, and as Francis Galton had told us a lot before, was yes, you can get wisdom from crowds, but it implies that you make a certain assumption that we are marginally better at making the right decision than making the wrong decision. Because when you aggregate it and you get a positive feedback loop from it, it will aggregate against the fact that some restaurants are better than others, but if we are marginally worse at making the right decision, then you just aggregate the bad instead. So that means there is no guarantee that a rating system, if it is not biased, if it is not that we are marginally better at making good decisions than bad decisions, or that you can build bubbles in the information market. And you can. To the highest degree. you talk about to design a system that makes us get better content. I'm talking about better intellectual content. We can do that, but it requires that we look at some abstract daily orders that are different and more than monetary. So far, the economic day order has deeply engaged a purpose, namely to sell a lot of ads to a lot of people for a lot of money. And the generative AI, as we know it today, has been used for this goal as well. But there is nothing that says that we just have to grow in money. We can also grow in knowledge, responsibility, trust. The European Union is making parametrizations of this, and our representatives are probably also making goals out of it. And if we start to grow other daily routines, and thus put a cap on what it is we understand growing up, then there is a complete and complete possibility that we are actually growing in information that in itself is more valuable than any other information based on all of wisdom and crowds in one end to some goals for where we understand and qualify information from the others. And there we have some guidelines for that. There is a reason for us to talk about scientific knowledge before reading in coffee grounds. What do you think about a country like China, now that you were in on this before? They have these social rating systems, where if you visit your old mother at the hospital, you actually get some social points. It's not the case in all of China, there are some different areas that are experimenting with it more or less. And if you then again and again run too fast or walk too fast, then you get minus points. And it also means something who you hang out with. But in the end, it's a question of surveillance. And we have seen some alarming examples of how Big Tech has also been overwhelmed. It has put itself first in connection with all the rating systems for selling products in one place, made large monopoly conclusions big monopolies and so on. And even the Americans, who are not the big supporters of monopoly-like conditions, because it's bad for a liberal market, they started to say, we're probably going to do something, it's going to be too big. So that means you can reach the overpopulation capitalism in two ways, either liberalist or stalinist, but it will all end in the same place. The rating economy is constantly evolving and it is expected to take new forms in the future. Here are three suggestions for new elements within the rating against 2050. 1. Emotional ratings. With the advent of AI, systems will emerge that analyze and rate human feelings in real time. Then a service or product can receive ratings based on their long-term social and economic impact on society and the environment. 3. Personalized rating. Where rating systems are adapted to the individual user's values and preferences, so two people see different ratings for the same product, all depending on their unique ethical, cultural and personal priorities. If we look towards 2050 and look at it not as an advertisement, but as a human being, we might get these AI bots, as Lars was saying, who try to work in your interests, in a way, to take the power home. Is there a possibility that we can create better quality? One of the things I wonder about is that we will also be able to translate it into all languages. It's coming now. So it's actually a global market. Denmark has been quiet and good here, you could say, with us relying on each other. But suddenly, all kinds of people from all countries and cultures can mix. Will it be a winner-takes-all, as we've seen, now towards 2050? Or can we get that decentral, smaller units that have access to each other? If the business model remains as it is now, then Mateus Principle will be introduced, and that means that those who are in the foreground are getting bigger, they are getting even bigger. We are starting to see some concentrations of power, both from infrastructure and democratic infrastructure, which we have never seen before. I wrote an article for OECD Forum not so long ago. Out of the nine critical infrastructure sectors that we have, Big Tech has their fingers down in everything but one, namely water supply. They have their fingers in everything else. And probably by 2028, they will own the physical incarnation of the network, because at that time they have about 30 transatlantic and silent cables. And that means they own the fiber optics, because of which the physical incarnation of the network, as we know it, looks like. Then they own the mosaic, they own the advertisers, they own the users, and they set the traffic and who has a voice and who doesn't have a voice. It is an absolutely insane potent power. And you should probably start thinking about it in a very liberal way, even if you are very liberal again, because you don't care that large concentrations are few hands, because their income is not beneficial for a heterogeneous liberal market. What do you think of that, Lars? I'm just thinking about my everyday life. I often buy books, and sometimes I want to buy them, but I can't get them as new, so I buy them used on Amazon. And then there's a reseller, and it says it's used, but in condition. Then I can rate it, first of all if it arrived and secondly if it was used but in good condition. If it is in good condition, I give it a top rating, but I buy from the reseller, there are probably many, but I buy from the one who has typically received the most good ratings. But I would like to hear your opinion when we get into the matter of where we rate each other on social media and on Tinder and so on. What are your views on that? There is of course something with large companies that run the platform, but what does it do for our fellow human beings and is it the right product we are setting up? Yes, but I think Lars, in that way I become a middle-aged Dysdragoon who wishes me back to the Goethe-Ferrum, the Pergament-Rule and that kind of thing. Because what is happening now is that we have the opportunity to rate what we are worth in social capital. We get likes, upvotes, who reacts to our posts, who watches our movies, who follows our playlists, etc. And that means that there will be a transparent stock market for what Lise Lotte is worth compared to what Lars is worth compared to what I am worth. And we have it, as Hannibal the Cannibal says in Silence of the Lambs, We cover what we see every day. We subtract what we see every day. Not something that is far away, but something we can relate to now and here. And because we have all become advertising sources for ourselves and thus also become our own media house, it is of course clear that no one is interested in seeing Vincent Hendrix with a toothbrush in his mouth and a bus man if I am to sell myself on social platforms. So that's why I always change myself a little bit. That's why there is a huge industry for filters where you you can change your jaw, mouth, eyes and everything else, based on an ideal view of what the ideal is. And if you can't handle it yourself, you can get filters to do it. But you can never live up to your own filters. Not even Kim Kardashian can live up to her own filters. Or Kylie Jenner, or who else could it be, Cristiano Ronaldo. And that means that we deeply do not relate to each other. We relate to the picture we can present about each other, and what Lars believes about my picture, and what I believe about Liselotte's picture, and so on. And you know what, if we now have to be a little philosophical, already that, Søren Kierkegaard had foreseen in either 1864, when he writes, or 1867, when he writes, where he says, if you only have your relational self out and about, then you are nothing, and you are only consistent in something in relation to the other. No subjective core. But what I am afraid of is that if we can always be together, then my existence is that I exist, I like it, I exist instead of thinking I thinking I exist. And that is a bit dangerous, because you can never live up to your own image. How could you live up to, if now Lise Lund-Lynge, who is now a parent, or Lars Tvedegård, I can never live up to that. And what does that mean? It's never good enough, and neither for myself. And. And what does that typically mean for people? Yes, it means that we have it with not having a lot of self-confidence, not having a lot of expectations, that we start to disagree and so on. So I'm not sure that this comparison economy, which we also live in on the social platform, is the best for some qualities that we want to as people, in favor of empathy. You make it sound like, and this is happening at a rapid pace, but more and more and more, you make it sound like we could experience the whole shit explode here before 2050, because it just becomes too much. Is it good? Yes, but it can also be good. Or that we say we don't want to have the waiting system, but we want to have influencers, almost as we know them, in such a small community that we have to go back to the fire engine or the fire and say, but these people I know, they don't have filters on, so it becomes a form of... But influencers are just big nodes in these networks, because their followers have a lot of out-of-the-box people. And that means they can affect a lot, and they can do that for the good, they can do that for the worse. We are talking about Taylor Swift, for example, in relation to the American midterm elections in 2019, where she wrote to 712 million followers on Instagram that she wanted to vote democratically, and she encouraged people to go down and vote for themselves. Not with the intention of voting democratically, but just to make democracy more robust. She was able to mobilize 64,000 new voters in 24 hours. That's more than the federal American state can do in three months. And that's what they call the Taylor Swift effect. So I know that was a good thing for you. But Cristiano Ronaldo, he was also really tired of Coca-Cola in connection with the European Championship in football. And when he comes into a press conference, there is a Coke and of Coca-Cola, because he was playing for the European Championship in football. When he got to a press conference, he saw a Coca-Cola and a Cola Light. He put them aside, took a bottle and said, Agua, on Monday morning Coca-Cola lost 20 billion dollars in shares. They were about to lose, but it wasn't helpful. If Mark Zuckerberg decided that the prices of housing in Switzerland should drop,, then what did my old man think of that? That he could really make a good sale of a market like that? I have a comment to make. You have said a lot of negative things about the role of large companies and ratings in social media. I think everyone can see that something is right or that everything is 100% right. But don't you open up a little bit to the fact that you have the big brands, like you have the big media companies. But in reality, via social media, there is a possibility that an individual, a single person, suddenly gets a lot of influence. I listen a lot to Lex Friedman's podcast, and he is a single person. It may be that there are some who help him a little, but he is a single person. He has millions of listeners and is in reality much larger than many of the large established multinational media companies. So there is nothing positive there. Yes, there is, Lars. I think we can say that we are still at many points in this time's real world. We just have to remember how far we are going back. Google is end of the 90's, Facebook is from 2004, the most widespread guesthouse among people today is like from 2009, TikTok is from 17-18 people, Instagram is from 14-15 people. It's an experience we have from yesterday. We have been humans for 250-270 years and for 20-25-30 years we have re-established our infrastructure, both the democratic and the more tangible one. And we still have to get used to that. And we don't have that habit. As late as 2019, Orrin Hatch, an American senator from Utah, asks Mark Zuckerberg, in connection with a hearing in the Congress, which has since become a meme, where he asks Mark Zuckerberg, how can you maintain a business model on Facebook, where people don't pay for their profiles? And then Mark Zuckerberg says, the immortal Senator, rerun ads. We run commercials. To which Orrin Hatch says, oh that's great, I never thought of that. And he is a lawyer in the USA. So just to say that our experience with this and our understanding of what the business model actually is, is an experience we have had since yesterday. And the first time that the economic business model is introduced, it is very heavy. It is actually Google itself, which has a motto that at that time was called Don't be evil. It is now written in a footnote. But it is so very well in the Overvågningskapitalism, where it says that when they introduce the commercial and commercial economic business model, they have their own capital of 80 million dollars. When they rate their stock three years later in 2004, they have their own capital of 3.2 milliard dollars. And that means they have a growth percentage of 25% and 50% in 3-4 years. It was so crazy. You have to remember that Facebook had red numbers on the bottom line until 2011, where Sheryl Sandberg goes from Google to Facebook and implements the same model. And we have just seen their quarterly turnover. They had a turnover of 15 billion or 17 billion dollars just for this quarter. So again, the growth in this awareness economy is probably not what we have seen before, and we have not fully understood what was it that was being dealt with. The law has not fully understood what we are dealing with. But that's where we have to look towards 2050 and at the very end we would like to get to an enlightenment age. That we get the good restaurants, the good books, the good pieces pieces, that you have someone sitting somewhere who doesn't know the elite, who also was in the good old days with white men who chose who came to some places. And we got that democratization. But then we can do up with commercials, then we can make some other business models where it is based on, Lars was talking about, that you could recognize some happiness, some feelings, some inspiration, some sense of recognition. And if you then again and again got to know that it is what moves you, Liselotte, you should not pay for a subscription like you do on Netflix for... The question is who decides that. Because you know, a lot can be said about Lars Tvede, but Lars Tvede is a liberalist, and I have a lot of respect for that. I have a lot of respect for... I think it's so funny to have both of you in the studio. I have a huge respect for the idea that the market is efficient when it comes to financial products, but also meaningful products. And when John Stuart Mill launches the idea, he doesn't call it the marketplace of ideas, but his basic idea is this, that now when we have the public conversation, or we have to vote in a jury, or whatever it may be, then we throw our ideas out on this market. And then we have to see how much conclusion there is. And if there is a significant conclusion to this, and we discuss this and some points survive, then it shows that the market is efficient. But, and here comes the big but, it suggests, also from Jon Stuart Mill or from Jon Perry Barlow, that there are level playing fields in the starting point. That the competition is equal. Because otherwise it is very easy to get some negative feedback loops, which supports some bad products, meaningful products, financial products and others. And so far I have't seen, neither in financial markets, but Lars can correct me, or at least in meaning markets, that the market for information products is an efficient market. What do you think about that Lars? Well, I think that each can create an account on social media and write whatever they want. And how many follow it depends on how much they rate it directly or implicitly. But one solution, which I think with many things, is to make more models. I also, why don't you make EU with four different member models? But if you take ex-twitter earlier and say, you can just put a filter on it, then you can say, I would like to have it all. I would like to have it filtered, so EU censorship will remove the things that I don't think I should have. And then people can choose for themselves. And in that way, it also happens if you censor. We had it quite violent during Covid, which was a very special situation, because millions of people's lives were in danger, and the whole society was closed down, and it was almost a military catastrophe. And then the authorities come in and censor, and it is relatively widely accepted, but it has two effects. Firstly, it shows that something they censored was right, and something they stood for was wrong. It shows in retrospect. And that's of course a huge disadvantage for Western civilization when you do that. But secondly, it also forms a huge sub-base of conspiracy theorists, which are still there. And I still see people who have all kinds of theories about these vaccines. And I think it would not have been better if everyone could just say what they wanted. And then there is an open debate about it instead of censoring it. And I think that also has something for us. You just have to remember that if we think about Covid, for example, then it was like this, that there was a non-nominable president, who is now called Donald J. Trump, who was about to say that we should drink hydrochloric acid to get rid of Covid. He was a big hit on Twitter with 80 million followers and that gave a lot of attention. So I agree with the idea. If it was just like that, I think that Herbert Simon in 1971 says it so prophetically. In 1971, Herbert Simon gets the Nobel Prize in 1978, but already in 1971 he says something very prophetic about an age of information. He says, in an information-rich world, wealth means information, and that means scarcity of something else. Awareness. It would be a scarcity of what is the end of information consumption, but what is consumption consumption is quite a complex consumption of the reception of attention. And there you have it. First, he is affecting the attention economy right there. And number two, he says, it is not the fact that you have got an interesting voice. It is how far your voice is heard. And you can manipulate that 20 times, as you were saying before, Lars. You can buy a click farm in China, then you should get enough attention. But Vincent, what do Vincent, if you look at the history and look forward to 2050, are there no more words coming out in the future than there have been before? From other cultures, other segments, other people? Are they it only tech giants and then a big bubble? Or have there not been more? There have been more and we have become more connected. That's a fact. And that's good in itself. There are also other voices and there are also other companies that could suddenly grow up, which could not grow grow before, especially in third world countries, that use social platforms to make their production and infrastructure. So there is a lot to say about it. So I'm not that angry about it. So in that respect, there is something really nice about it. Period. But I think, when that is said, that you make yourself unnecessarily dependent on 30-50 people sitting in Silicon Valley. And we saw that when we had the big Facebook blackout last year or last year or whatever it was. It hit the poor populations really hard. So you're not against recommending each other? No. And that you talk up or down and that there is this wisdom of crowds? No. There are also problems with that. We know that the bad stories are faster than the good ones, and if you've had a good experience, you don't want to tell about it. So it's only the extremes that are shared. We know that from Jonah Berger, who wrote the fantastic book Contagious in 2013. He says, if you want a story to go viral, you have to get into people's activity-mobiling feelings. So if you ask a psychologist about our feelings, they divide into two axes. They can be positive, negative, activity-mobiling or demobilizing. So if I write on the internet, I'm so happy today. Nobody gives a damn. It's simply because joy and a positive feeling is not activity mobilizing. So what can Lars write them good for you Vincent? But if I write on the net, it's simply too bad with those immigrants. They are walking across the border. They take our marzipan bread and our skipper mix and our gold crits. Peace works because peace is an activity mobilizing feeling. So when I get peace, I want to do something. I want to share, comment, upload, rate, do all sorts of things. And that means that we have a large arsenal of negative activity mobilizing feelings. Indignation, peace, anxiety, fear, harm and that kind of thing. If speech is salt, timidity is gold and time is money, what is attention then? There are many answers to that, but it has at least such a great value that there has been an entire economy around it. The attention economy. This is one of the reasons why many of the most widespread apps in the world are designed around elements from casino games that have dependency-creating tendencies. Because the central business model is to capture your attention and hold it in 2050. You're in your prime. You say, you were visiting Supertrends that time, and wow, what a fantastic thing What was it like that we got a new period where people had nuanced conversations, they went deep? There are also good things to say, and we have also started to understand now, because our experience horizon is so short, even the big tech giants have started to understand. We are different from just bond breeder and rating systems. And now you have to remember, we are in 2050, AI works, we translate into all languages, what has happened, we have everything to let go. What has happened is that we have made, and the big tech giants have gigant, we are making a moderation on the development of generative AI. Elon Musk has written about it, even though we have written about other things. Because now we have to find out what we should actually use it for. What is it we want to stimulate here? Is it respect and knowledge and cohesion and trust or is it just about making some money? Because I can tell you that if I ask about money, I will take people's attention and then I will sell porn and I will sell weapons. We are on that. Exactly, we are already on that. But then we found out that it was actually not quite like that. So we found some growth parameters where we could measure trust, responsibility responsibility, empathy and other things. Where we found out that we can actually stimulate the power of communication also with triggers. Don't you think that's why China for example makes education TikTok videos for children? Yes, they do it also because they want to, as I said before, to look like a certain way. That's the next thing, but they do it also so that they can see... They tell the kids, you must be on for 40 minutes a day knowing that there are many ways to go. And then they give the U-pilot vision to the western world, so they can sit for 11 hours and look and scroll down over some crazy thing. You just can't do that in China. And that's because they have a certain way of thinking a social model on. I don't write down on that social model to notice. But therefore you can be inspired by if they have some goals or can be involved in developing some goals for something that we also want to put a price on here. But we should not go over where the overpopulation capitalism takes over. Neither liberal nor Stalinist. So they are out. Big Tech is out with their advertising models. We are perhaps one that has started with micropayment, where we pay with our joy and knowledge level. Who will then decide what is hot and not in 2050? Follow the money, etc. on. I'm afraid to say that... Yes, but now we're in a new scenario here. If we're in the new scenario, then it's like this, and it's probably a bit difficult for everyone to write down, but in the new scenario, science has become sexist again, and so has slowness. It's It is not sex to have opinions, it is sex to have qualified opinions. It is sex to be welcome, to show empathy and trust in everything. And it has become sexist that we have a high degree of common knowledge, but not necessarily a high degree of information. Because that's where I think the problem is. The amount of information has never been higher, but the amount of common knowledge is just not fully included. And that means our tendency to coordinate has become worse. One challenge is that we can't see the long-term consequences. And we can just as soon as you put a graph on our whole lives and ask what kind of life you want to have. So isn't it also about having the knowledge here and now? What does it mean on the long run? Yes, we need to have it now. We have also started to get these ideas about what it means in the long run. The problem we have had as researchers for a long time is that Big Tech has not wanted to give up their data to us so we could do checks and balances functions on how their initiatives and friction strategies and everything else worked. And now they have started, some of them, to be a little more open about it and the DSA itself says that they must be more open. Because so far we have not been able to look at them in the cards. We have no idea how their business model was put together and how their fictions and architecture were put together. And we haven't been able to do any checks and balances. And we only know a little about it because Francis Haugen with his Facebook files showed that Facebook was left with information that Instagram was a pure poison for young children and especially girls. And they knew that, but they didn't get anything out of it, so it was their tobacco moment. Just to say that they know more about how it is that we have it, at some point, than probably we others do. Yes, I think we should go back to the recommendation economy. Do we still have Michelin stars at that time? Do we still have taste judges who taste and investigate? Or is it bottom-up, that is, it's driven by the people's own opinions? If you ask me about that. If we assume, according to your answer, that the business model is the same as it has always been, then you can think that we have exactly that. Because that's where a lot of money is being made. It's about someone recommending something to someone else. So until then, yes, we will have it. My hope is that, for example, when we start making some limitations in the business model, you only have to lose data three days back, then your searches on sticker planes are not as good, but you get a sticker plane. The problem is, we can only allow it. It is completely unhindered with data trawling, and we can give the business model a free run, then it will not change a thing. Follow the money will still not be the same. Recommendation economy, rating economy. Is it nice to have or is it a need to have? Before it became electronic, people talked about each other and wrote about each other in media. They talked about each other as gossip and so on. 80% of all communication is slander. It is simply part of human nature nature. So what I mean is that we can, in one way or another, rate what we experience as a need to have for a functioning society. So it's just a question of how we tame it. I think that with taming it, we don't get into what to do when you are attacked, as I was at the beginning. It's very difficult to be protected as an individual. And Vincent also talked about these companies, that if they are suddenly shut down from the platform, they no longer have a company. So there is a great vulnerability in it too. But there can be more to it. Now we also have, for example, when you go on websites, you have in Europe all that with, that every single time you have to click on those damn cookies. And it would be very nice if you could just say in your settings, I accept no cookies or I accept all cookies. I would say that I accept all cookies, because when I have to look at ads, they are more relevant to me. Most people will probably say no cookies, but it's something where we should try to make it practical and we should try to give people the opportunity to choose what they want. And there will be a huge problem with that artificial intelligence that will know more about us than Google and all these social media. And then there will be something with... I can't help but think, we didn't get that much into it, but about all these large language models, if they can take over, so Google actually dies in 2050. But that thought is old. was already mentioned by Eric Schmidt in 2011. Eric Schmidt is the old CEO of Google. He said in a quote to the New York Times, I think it was an article, where he said, I don't think people want to have, I don't think people want to search on Google. They want Google to tell them what to do next. The point is that the only way that such generative AI's can work is very personalised. There is one principle that speaks for it. More data about us. Because then they can make these answers even better. And I have in my conscience, really hard to understand, that if you are a big lover of freedom, that you would buy your freedom by giving away data because it is more effective. Because it does not necessarily mean that just because they know more about me, that my freedom will be greater. On the contrary, and that's what Eric Schmidt says, they just have to tell me what to do next time, then I can break my own head and my own autonomy. And I really think that's a high price to pay for an effective answer. The result we get out of Generative AI will be one-to-one function of what kind of data it is trained on. And if it is not trained on data where it can give complete answers, then randomize it or edit it according to some guidelines that are relatively intransparent. And then it is not a truth. Right now we have BBC, which refuses to give it data. We have DR, which refuses to give it data. It doesn't look good for the quality of what it can create. No, it doesn't. And we see it too. Google has just launched their latest new app filter, which means that when Lars Tvede is sitting with a company where there are two people he doesn't know, he just wants to edit them out. You can't see that. At the same time, they have written down on Code of Contact, when it comes to digital services, Nice to have, or need to have? It's need to have. Slowly or fast, this change, especially if we go from googling things to artificial intelligence and personal AI that recommends things instead of the usual rating systems we have known before. I think in contrast to many other technologies we discuss in these radio podcast programs, the fast has already happened according to my observations. We have really, really entered that world already. But there are new aspects to it. Personal AI will definitely be one of them. We also have to learn to live with it, and there will probably be bad and good measures. I think we are better off living with it in 2050 than we are today. Will it be difficult or expensive to invest in what you are talking about, and make this platform to rate journalists? Is it something you can just give up on yourself? The thing is that some of the most valuable companies on the stock exchange today are completely based on rating. So in that way it is very easy to invest in it. But there are always new business models coming up, so it is something that is current all over the business world, both startup companies and existing companies. Rich, sustainable or clever? Where you heard Vincent? Yes, I think it makes the economy more efficient, so it contributes to wealth, because people, really bad products, they are just thrown out of the market. Sustainable and I agree with Klo, I would say that we are still learning a lot from it. This with. This is a supertrend? That's a very high level. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends.

We open up. MDMA is also what goes under the name ecstasy, which I tried. We, especially in Europe, have had a tradition that we almost for all drugs under development requires that you have the final results. And what if they get it on the long run? There is not much data that indicates that. We open up to come in and notice this. That means we can can get to the root of it, find out the cause, where they come from. There hasn't been anything that has helped everyone. It sounds like it could be a cure. This is Supertrends, the show where we inquire about all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator when we had the experiments in the flower power period. and many of them went horribly wrong. People got psychosis and never returned from their trip. But now there are new measurement, dosage and treatment forms that make some caregivers have imagined a net zero trauma future towards 2050. So this episode is very curious about these psychedelic substances. But we can still be a game changer. Welcome to Supertrends. I have seen that some people have a hypothesis that the reason we move from a collective society to a rural society is because they ate some of these mushrooms on their trip and then they tripped and thought, why don't we just stay here? What is your relationship to psychedelic substances? I think this is a very interesting topic, because we are now making all these different radio and podcast programs about the future. And something that has come up in many of our episodes is something about the brain. That you can use the brain computer interface to read and read out the three dimensions. What is life in the brain when you do one thing or another? But of course it is also super exciting what you can do with psychopharmacists of different species. And this thing about using mushrooms and other things is something that has emerged from time to time and people have lost interest in it due to the experiments you mentioned And another recurring theme we have had in many programs is how we get a moderate relationship to all the new technologies we find, and this is what I mean by a technology. So it's this civilisation process in our coexistence with different technologies. The SuperTrends machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives a signal when future groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. That's it, and when I look at the timeline, there are two psychedelics that have appeared a few times. It is psilocybin and MDMA. And the first two things I want to highlight for our timeline is that I would like to say the same, that something has been approved in Australia, so Australia is really ahead here. But there are two prognoses from the, namely that in 2024 the first clinic opens, it is called a PAT, a psychedelic assisted therapy clinic, that it opens in the USA, based on psilocybin, and then in 2025, FDA, which is their authority that approves psychopharmacology and other medicine, approves MDMA. So there is a expectation that these things will be legal and used in the USA, and then of course a lot of other countries that use it. I might just say that MDMA is also under the name Ecstasy, which I tried when I was reading in England and went to London on a rave. And it was pretty wild. I was standing in the queue with two Swedish au pair girls. We went to the toilet, because one of them always threw up when it started to work. I thought, why is she doing this? While I was standing there in the toilet, I suddenly saw the most beautiful people I had ever seen. I spoke all spoke all languages and I shared the phone number with at least 200 people that night. It was really mind-blowing and it required all my willpower not to go back and try it again. And for a long time I thought, okay, the whole world will be put down under this. Yes, and then we get into our degree of independence. I think we should talk more about that. For example, if you look at a scale, then psilocybin is not particularly dependent. Then we have 2026, when a PIT will be opened in the USA to help with substance addiction or other addiction. And in 2027, it will become part of the normal teaching material on medical education. It will be expanded, and it is part of what you need to understand. Then we go around with wearables that measure all kinds of steps, sleep, heart rate, blood sugar sometimes and so on. And there is an integration between that and the use of these psychedelic psychopharmacists that we are talking about. And of course it is relevant for micro dosage, where these variables can tell you when you can be able to have them. Yes, it is certainly very different what one has to compared to the other. We take different things. Then we have psychedelic therapy centers starting to spread globally. It's 2029. And if you have good experiences with it and find out that we can get something really good out of it under certain conditions, then the big pharmaceutical companies start to put artificial intelligence on and tune these things or create something completely new. And that will probably be able to be done relatively effectively, because you can simulate how the protein is falling in three days and all that stuff. And 2031 is when you use psilocybin to help people in their last days or months when they are terminally ill and later on you use it for eating disorders. You could just make it a part of Arne's pension. In 2032, the health insurance companies start to approve it, so that you can get it refunded. Normally it takes a while after something new has been invented. There is a pretty radical one, it's 2038, that you think you might be able to use to prevent, treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, which are huge, huge people diseases. So it's very exciting and I'm really excited about this program. I'm so excited because you were talking about anorexia, it's very difficult to treat. Many of the mental sufferings we have are expensive and difficult to treat. So if you could shoot some kind of way back and make things smarter, then it would be fantastic. Long before the market for psychedelic therapy is matured or defined, there is already a patent war to attract future territories to themselves. Among the most remarkable in the game are British Compass Pathways. The company has become famous and targeted for going aggressively its work with attempts at patenting of very basic aspects of a treatment, such as dimmed lighting, soft furniture or even just holding the patient's hand during the session. While some argue that aggressive patenting risks damaging research and ultimately makes treatments inevitably expensive for patients, others argue that patents promote research and help psychedelic therapy out in the mainstream. In all cases, the patent war confirms that the potential of the treatment is enormous. Then I would like to welcome you, René Ernst Nielsen. You are a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Clinical Institute at Aalborg University, a professor in the department of bipolar management. You have led the Danish part of an international phase 2b study in psilocybin for the treatment of depression. Welcome back. Rebecca Russell, you are an authorized psychologist and integration therapist. You have your fingers in the ointment. It's not legal to take these psychedelic substances, but you have actually done a whole treatment around it. Try to describe what it is. So integration therapy is therapy before psychedelic trips and it is therapy after. So I take me of the preparation and I take me of all the material that comes up. When they have been in psychedelics, it is often MDMA or psilocybin. And tell the listeners, what is the difference between MDMA and psilocybin? Oh, there is of course also a difference in what you research and what I see as private practitioners, because I see everything. I see people who use it for self-development. I see people use it to get to know themselves better. I see people use it to get different psychiatric diagnoses, to treat trauma. And it's a little different what they use and try. It's much more more experimental. I get to see people trying to do this, for good and for evil. You can't say that one substance is better for post-traumatic stress, for example, and the other is better for depression? I would say post-traumatic stress syndrome, PTSD, we would probably go towards MDMA. Because MDMA is more sensitive, you become more of your body, that is, you can take MDMA and then you can still go out and shop. You can go out on the street, you can smile a little more to people and think the world is a little more beautiful and nicer, but it's not as disruptive as psilocybin can be. MDMA is also what we can call an empathogen, so it goes in and does what is called a heart opener. And people who have been exposed to PTSD, that is to say they have been attacked, incest, they have been soldiers, it can be a conspiracy, failures, whatever it is that has been put in them. So what the MDMA does is that they come down in tempo. It closes a little down, you could say, amygdala, our alarm readiness center in the brain, so we no longer get afraid of what meets us. That is, and this is where we are already getting into the therapeutic part, the mygdala becomes inactive while it increases dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and oxytocin increase the hormone and neurotransmitter substances in you, you get an optimal condition, which you are in for a long period of 6-8 hours, where you can dive into your trauma, where you can suddenly go through it, where you can experience it again, but now from a completely different place, a safe place, a place where you feel love for yourself, we can call it compassion, it's a place where we feel mindfulness, so we have this heart open where you can come down into your body, feel how it feels, feel your feelings, your thoughts, your body sensations. From there you can be guided much more closely through the traumatic experience you have experienced or the circumstances. And afterwards, when you have become completely normal again, can you then go back to that otherwise strained situation? Can you remember it all? Or do you get dizziness, like if you've been on drugs? No, and that's what's so beautiful about it. Some can have a little feeling of dizziness afterwards and get a headache the next day. There might be different side effects, but the studies show that it's a passing thing. But you can remember it all, and that's what's so interesting, and exciting, and giving. You can suddenly step in and say, God, this is what the attack did to me, this is what this car accident did to me, this is what the abuse I experienced did to me, I developed this, I made the world look like this. I don't want to be in this world anymore, I want to work with that. So as a psychologist, get a way into people's inner self, which otherwise would have taken many therapy hours, that people can find their way through their trauma. That they become experts in their own lives. These two psychopharmacological or psychedelic treatments, are they symptom treatment or can they actually cure problems? That's a really good question. I would like to answer that. I know that MAPS, which I support a lot, is saying that it's not symptom treatment, because we get to the root cause. The difference between that type of psychopharmacist and the one we use a lot in psychiatry, and what we see with what we're on our way to now, is that the difference is that it is something that dampens the symptoms. Symptom dampening, anxiety dampening, whatever it is. So the symptoms we have should be dampened. We should not be in contact with them. What is so radically is that we open up to come in and feel this. We can come down to their roots, we can find out the cause of their death. It is not a cure in the way that you have it good from now on until the day you die and you do not experience any pain. You still have the memories, you have still been exposed to what you have been exposed to. It's a part of your life, but you don't need to run away from it anymore. You can stand with it, you can carry it, so you can hold it with a sense of humility. It sounds like it can be a cure. And we're going that from our next guest. He is a professor in psychiatry and has actually done some scientific research on this. So welcome to you. Thank you. What do you say? If we start with whether it is healing or not. It is an academic approach to it. I don't think we can talk about healing. For one simple reason, one should imagine that one took a person who had had depression or PTSD and brought them back to a level where they had the same risk as the background population to develop psychiatric conditions. And I don't think that's what they do. There's not much that indicates that the data we have, that we've gone that way. But it looks like it's much more effective to reduce the episode the person is in, to reduce the symptoms, and also to keep the symptoms away longer than the treatment we have right now. So it's a paradigm shift, we also talked about why it's a paradigm shift, it's another way of thinking about treatment, but taking a half-breed is a bit of a strange thing. It's a bit like if you have a patient patient with bad lungs because they have been running all their life and you give them antibiotics for their lung function, then they still have their ability to sleep to get lung function again. And a little bit the same here. Even if you treat the symptoms they have, they still have, it risk of getting psychiatric conditions and therefore the help is a problematic word to use about it. René, now Rebecca talked about MDMA, could you tell us about psilocybin? Psilocybin is naturally present in different mushrooms, including the spiced onion hat. It is something that has been used for many, many years, but it has probably been used quite frequently over the past 25 years. Especially a professor named David Nott from England has researched a lot about whether it could be used for addiction prevention and also for treatment of conditions that were very forced. Then some studies have been made originally, something you had in your timeline, on whether you can reduce depressive symptoms, actually depressions, when you are dying, for example from cancer? End stage depression? Do you try them because they say yes to anything, or is it because they can do something very special in relation to death anxiety? I think you have tried it because when you have such things approved, you have to go through some different parts and you can sometimes be allowed to try some things with patients where there are no other treatment options. Of course, it is still fully enlightened, but where you can actually be allowed to try it. It is also where we sometimes see some drugs come in faster without having to go through the same test because it's for a very small group of patients or for a very vulnerable group where you can't wait until you want to take a test. But the small studies showed originally that there is something to be done. There is something here that you can't do otherwise. If we then go to the swamps, which I have also tried. And that was because I had to undergo microdosing, and then he gave me what he gave me a lot. So it turned out to be much more than that. Microdosing. Yes, but what was so interesting was that he who took me on this trip, he also very good at giving me an intention to spend 4-5 hours. And I got a wow, that art fills our society a little too much. That we are all empowered and in reality are the creators of our lives and the creation. And we have been here before and when I got out of it again, I stopped eating meat for a long time so I would say I fell back to some of my bad habits but it was really a game changer, it was not just a matter of time. It took a long time to fill. I think that is another challenge. It took a long time to follow these patients. What do you do practically when you run these studies, René? There is a protocol that clearly describes how we should handle our patients. Both what type of patients we can bring. Here we had patients with depression. Depression that we hadn't had time to treat with conventional drugs. That were not self-sufficient, that were not or had been psychotic and that had no use. So it's a select group, but it's something with security in relation to who we dare to give medicine to. Then they came in and had three preparatory talks. What could they expect? They were in the room where they were supposed to have treatment. They got some tools for how to handle anxiety that often arises along the way. What could you be worried about be worried about? Then they came in on the same day, where they were to be exposed to the two therapists they had had in these preparatory talks. They received this medication in the morning. Then they were there all day until the last afternoon. As a rule, at noon, at 1-2 pm, it was a bit strange, because they were not completely alone, but they felt like they were back to normal. They shared a breakfast, and then around 4-5 pm they came back home the next day and had three integration talks afterwards. And did they have any intentions about what makes them sad? No. There is no treatment, it is the raw material that makes something new. There is something about talking about what they have experienced, but it is not like you go in and say that this is what you should look at. And it probably has a lot to do with the way we think of psychiatry. We don't think there is a definite solution to depression. We see, on the other hand, that patients become depressed. We also see that there is probably a genetic connection, because there is a greater incidence if the mother and father have depression, and then there is a greater risk for children from depression, and there is also a greater risk for siblings from depression. So we see there is a genetic component in it. We hardly believe that everything is trauma-free. There can be something that destroys it, but the vulnerability is there. Is this a big experiment in something was otherwise written down? Or is it just something we can repeat over and over again? It depends on what you think about a big experiment, but a couple of hundred million dollars to be able to complete it. Wow. An intermediate large experiment, but it's not us us who covered it. It's the company that has created a way to make synthetic psilocybin. The problem with psilocybin in mushrooms, which you may have experienced, was... I don't know what I get. I don't know if I got 10 mg, 20 mg. I don't know if it's completely clean, if there's anything else in it. I can't put it on a shelf, so I can get it as a pill. We would like to have, if it's medicine, a shelf life, so we can have it lying on a shelf, so we don't have to go out in the woods to find it. And we would like to know that the active ingredient is stable, so we know if we have 10 mg of lignin today, then we also have 10 mg the drug in the body in 3 or 6 months. So it doesn't go down over time. What is your hypothesis here? Does it work? Have we got any kind of depression? It's a common disease at the moment. Phase 2 studies show that it works. How much does it work? The type of patients we have with us, if we look at them in conventional studies then there is about 1 out of 10 that has an effect when we give a conventional treatment. When we give psilocybin in this patient group, then there is about a third that achieves full effect, that is to say without symptoms. So it is three to four times as effective, but it is not because it cures everyone. Are there any that make it worse? Not any we have seen. If we look at the academic studies, we have not patients who have become psychotic, and it probably plays a little bit in that we also exclude them from who previously have been psychotic, those who have a lot of risk factors for it. But I'm just wondering if it is mentioned that it can be used, already in this conversation we have mentioned that it can be used against PTSD, but then there are others on eating disorders, on anxiety, maybe even on neuro-generative diseases. If something can be used on many things, then I think, is it also right? If you look into the brain, then our most extensive signal substance in the brain is the serotonin. The serotonin regulates many things. If we look at what the psilocybin does, if we look at the scan we can do, then we have networks where the brain communicates with different areas between each other. And they are very locked when we have grown up. When we are children, it is quite a lot, we do new things all the time. What we can see in patients who have been exposed to psilocybin is that we are starting to create new networks again. And it is probably one of the things that makes something that was locked before, is locked up anymore. So the fact that you have an effect on the condition that is seen as symptom-wise very locked up, depression, ruminating thoughts about the same, OCD, forced thoughts, forced actions, eating disorders, extremely high control over how you take in the first, second and third, then it makes a lot of sense that you can have something that works on the same symptoms, even if the way it presents itself is different. To make psychedelic therapy a permanent offer in the future health care, you must make sure that the treatment is as effective and as accessible as possible. And here the innovation of the medical companies plays a central role. Since it is extremely expensive to have health personnel walking up and down a half day, as for example an LSD trip can take, some companies try to develop alternative variants of the consciousness-developing substances that reduce the time of action significantly. And since the consciousness-developing part of psychedelic treatment seems to be very effective, many. Other companies are working on synthetic psychedelics that guarantee a totally hallucinogenic experience. Rebecca and René, you have different approaches to working with psychedelics. There is a lot of stigma in this and there are many critical voices out there. Do you think we can keep up with that thanks to science, René, in 2050? That science can be documented, that it can be used for something? I have no doubt that if we can show it works, then it will have a place in some form of treatment. When I was a boy, it must have been a few years ago, I remember there was a description in the TV-advisor that there was a broken brown bag with horse dung in it. Ketamine that could be misused. And it was very dangerous, I it was very dangerous, if you found it, you should have finally called the police. But we use it now. Ketamine, good to give an S in summary, but S-ketamine, Jansen Silak has just been approved for treatment of depression. It has got a new life there. So I'm not in doubt that things that we've thought negatively about can get a whole new life. I think that something that removes a part of the stigmatization that can be, is probably that you can actually show that it works. That you can be a little disagreeable about who it works for and who should have it and how the regulation should be, whether it should be freely available or something that is closely regulated. I could imagine that we could be a little less agreeable. Rebecca, I know you're going to Iceland and all kinds of places. A lot is happening at the moment. Where are they far ahead in the world with these therapy forms? As Lars mentioned, Australia is well on its way afterwards, and USA, I would say, are the ones who are the furthest out. I would just say, in Denmark we also have a study on alcohol addiction here in Copenhagen, and I think one should think that we, especially in Europe, have had a tradition that we almost for all drugs in development requires that you have the final results. One of the assumptions has been that we have made it possible to use medical cannabis, even though data does not really support any effect at all. It is not the classic way of looking at how things work, but that's what they've chosen to do as a test. But otherwise, they've had the tradition of going all the way through to get it right. I was very fascinated by something you said earlier, namely you told us about how the philosophy of synonyms affects how we create serotonin, which is one of the four major hormones of joy in the brain. And it's a network of nerves that does that. And then you say that you can reopen for new nerve pathways to be created. And then I get some thoughts about, hold on, can you do brain training so you can train your brain to become happier? And can it be 20-60 steps, whole processes where you take a person and make them happy by making those nerves grow new way. I see it as a little less aggressive than that. I think that I'm a bit off-limits. You can make new connections, which potentially can be a good thing, if it's good connections, but it can also be a negative thing. That's why it's important with the integrative therapy because it can go wrong. That's one thing. The other thing is, what I've seen in patients who have been with depression, it would have been much less what I see at the beginning. I had a patient who had a very nice description of having depression. He stood on top of a mountain and could see the landscape. There were other mountain tops, there was a forest, a valley. It was the problems and challenges that were the good things in his life. Then he took a psilocybin and was moved to another mountain top. It was not because the landscape changed, he just saw it from another angle, so he could act in a different way. I had a patient who said that it was a week after she had been exposed, that she had said yes to taking a trip with her daughter. So she said, you know, it's more than two years since you said yes to taking a trip. And you can say that the automatic no was then said, okay, it was not because she was happy about it, but the little things where you go from saying no to saying yes, or to saying no instead of saying yes, might make you change little things in your life. And the end of the behavior probably also does something to get the mood. So I don't see it as a quick fix, but more to open up to doing other things. Yes, I think we very interesting here, because I think it's a social tendency, so we want to get to the light, the happy, where it doesn't hurt, no pain, no discomfort. It's called necrony. And that's not what it does. It teaches you to be in your wholeness. It teaches you to be able to space out everything you are. It teaches you to be able to space out your own sorrow, your joy, your anger, your guilt, your shame, your wonder. That you can feel that there are no more places you need to go through. So I can be with myself. And being able to be with yourself, where you are, how you feel, is actually enormously liberating. And there you can see that people, some of what they have described to me, where I am lucky, you could say, I think, is that I hear so many different stories from so many different types of people who have so many different lives. When you do research, you try to get some kind of group. I don't sit with that. I'm in the group of all kinds of people. And one of the things that I find interesting is that everyone describes what you're getting into, Liselotte. Everyone describes a feeling of greater belonging, that art is more about us all belong together, we belong to the climate, to nature, we are nature. And that was my question to you, because now we are going out in 2050, and now we see that everyone, including Lars, has had a trip through the therapy machine, not because he is making mistakes, but because he needs to to be improved. Because it is a big trend. We are doing everything possible to improve ourselves all the time. And when we did that, one could imagine that it affected our political status, our climate view, because some of what is happening is somehow, for me, that one's ego is being moved aside and one sees oneself as a whole with others. And that is very rare today, where there is such a hyper-individualized focus, that one can let go of that ego. Could you imagine that it could be so radical that it actually moved our behavior out in reality? One of the things I hope we can cure with this, so to speak, if we're talking about cure, is loneliness. We are so far away from each other, we have lost contact with ourselves. That's what I experience, at least a lot of people who feel that. I can't feel myself, I can't feel my connection to me or to someone else or to nature. And then when they start going through these processes, they are hard, they are boring, it's not a quick fix. But that distance between them and the rest of the world is reduced, so the loneliness is reduced. So if it turns out as I would like, it will have an impact on our politics and the way we are together in society. I don't think so. I think it will help a group of patients. The weapon we have to treat the condition is getting bigger. I think it's important to change the treatment. It's another way of thinking. But I don't think it will help everyone. I think it will have harmful effects for some. If we look at psychotherapy in general, there are 20% who have a worse performance by having had psychotherapy compared to not having had it. So I don't think it will help everyone. I think we should be really good at pointing them out where we think it works and then give it a real test, then there are some who will have clearly better effects than others. We have not yet found anything, despite what we look at, of all medicine, all treatment, that works on everyone. So why should this do that? But that's what we're getting into. What is working? And then we talk again about downsides and openings, Because when we talk about side effects of therapy, that 20% get it worse. Yes, people get worse when they go into therapy. We open up, we open up for all the material there is inside. We get closer to what hurts. We get closer to their soreness. So many will experience instability. And I see that as maybe that's what we should be able to bear to be in. So we should like to get it better. We shouldn't stay there, but it's an intermediate stage to get it better. Fantastic. It has become a whole debate program, René. As a doctor, I would like to reduce. And if the outcome is that patients get worse function, that they get more symptoms, that they get a poor quality of life, then I don't think it's good that they go through it. What if they get it on the long run? There is not much data that indicates what they do. So for that reason, I would still stick to it. I think it's good for some, for there hasn't been anything that has helped everyone. I would also like to say, that without being a specialist, I have read a lot of analyses, that there is a part of people who get a worse psychological treatment. They explain it in Jutland that if you touch the shit, it smells more. Sometimes the fog is worse than if you rub it around. But for 80%% might help. I think we should stick to 2050. We have people who come with crisis traumas, for example, stress from the great public illness, anxiety, anorexia, so there is a group of people who are almost not on the right path. You mentioned the psilocybin and that there is no treatment for it. What do you think about the whole MDMA-way, where you visit your traumas again? Is that something you think we should keep in the safe for the Christian veterans? I think. If we look at the data, it's quite effective. Again, not for everyone, but about two thirds of the population have an effect of NMDA compared to PTSD, compared to only a third when they get placebo. So we win a third. But René, are we then in 2050? You want to measure and you want to do science. Can we simply scan the brain in real time and see if something is happening? Does it work? How far will we go to create data? A part of psychiatry is just about this. How do you are doing now. How can you make objective goals about who is moving and who is not? I think we are getting further by measuring how many symptoms people have, what their quality of life is, what their function is. These are three important goals most patients have. Do I have it well? What can I do? If we can move on from that, I think many patients will be happy about it. The data we have now indicates that we can move it to some patients, but far from all. And the data we have also indicates that we may need to use it earlier, use it for more patients. If we look at psilocybin, then the opposite of what we are doing now with treatment of depression, then psilocybin gives a cure, it gives an explanation. And what you are putting up to now, then you wait and see how it goes. So if they get a relapse in two weeks, then they a new cure and then their depression will disappear hopefully again. Whereas with the ones we have now, we give them a pill and then we say, you should continue to take it. If you have had one depression, you should take it for a year, and if you have had two, you should take it for a year. If you have had three, four, five, you should take it for life. And it is a side effect of what state you are in, take. So for that reason, I think the paradigm is very interesting for those where it works. I definitely agree. And I would say that if you try with one, then you could maybe try with the other. Is there a possibility to get started with it today, or is it on trial basis? Just now there was a trial. And that is a trial. The different pharmaceutical companies, FDA and EMEA in Europe, require a certain pharmaceutical development. We have just been through phase 2. We will soon start phase 3. It started in the USA and will start in Europe in the future. If phase 3 studies show the same results, then you can apply for what you call a approval and market-based approval. And then it can actually be on the shelves. In 2050? No, in three years, two-three years. Already? Yes. That sounds good. Rebecca, you are so lucky that you can do these hyper-individualized procedures for your patients. But René, you are aware that you need a critical mass that needs to go through exactly the same treatment regime to make some evidence. If you didn't think about that, but just think about getting maximum impact, would you like to do it much more individualized than what you are forced to? Make some different variations, more conversations, combinations? What would you dream of if you could follow the science? But what other factors could you think of? Something of the things I find very interesting is how the experience is. I have one of my project psychologists who wants to do a PhD on what the experience is and the expectation of getting psychedelics and what the experience is after, what has changed. I think it's super exciting. I just don't think you can get away from it from a methodological, scientific point of view, that you need a starting point where they don't know what they get. They know they are participating in a study, they know they probably get one or the other, but otherwise there is a very, very big effect of just participating in the study. For example MAPS, which is run on MD MDMA in relation to PTSD. It is a third of the amount that just for calcium pills, which has a super effect on it. So the experience of getting something gives a lot in relation to this. And I would also say, you are really, really cute Rebecca, and just that if you are lonely and sit and talk to you. But I think that there is something about it. It may be that they have gotten calcium pills in these experiments, but they have received therapy. And that's what is so important, both with psilocybin and MDMA. The research is great now. It is medicine assisted therapy. It cannot be separated from each other. They are connected and the connection must be connected. That's why integration therapy is so important. But it also says that therapy in itself is effective for many. We can discuss how many and all kinds of other things about it. But of course there are some who want want to get it better by just saying that they are going to therapy. The fact that I say that therapy is not working, I do not necessarily agree with that. A very funny example is when we have given electroshock therapy, then we have also done such false electroshock therapy, where we have randomized, i.e. we allow the patient to be divided into just being dead and wake up again or get ECG. The effect of getting dead is high because you think you have received treatment. So the belief in getting treatment means a lot. I'm not saying therapy doesn't work, but I think if you had compared and said, I take a group here, which we say you get only therapy, then we have a and a group of people who get active treatment, then the therapy group will be less able to cope. Because we want to believe that things work. It's super cool. The patient experiences the same effect. So there are two thirds of the effect of getting MDMA, even though a third of the effect is maybe placebo. It doesn't do anything, it works. But to say if it really works or just the belief that it works, we need that type of study. Now we're going out, because all that placebo and where we are now, there are lots of podcasts and discussions about, but it's a bit about what in the long run. And I know now you mentioned this with MAPS and him, Vic Doblin, he says he has a vision with net zero trauma in 2070. What does net zero trauma mean? It means that we will find out how to accept our traumas and be able to handle our traumas and be in them when we get there. Now, it's not super special thing, it's good that some people want to deepen it a little, but it's the way it goes. If you believe in it, it's a little something else, but it's a great vision to have. What do you say, what does it mean? Yes, I would like to have Rick himself deepen it, but yes, it's not about a course and we don not experience trauma. It would be completely naive to think that way. But the fact that we can stand in it, and when we are exposed to something traumatic, that we can go and get some treatment. I also think that what he talks about a lot is that we go so long untreated. We go with our trauma for so long, and it has very big consequences. Among other things because we know that genetics will be lost. So what happens if we can actually do trauma therapy and help people's traumas much faster than we do now? So we simply have created a bigger and better balance between the trauma mind and thesense. And René, you weren't completely aware of the fact that when you have had a psychedelic experience, you can get insights that you take with you in your attitude to society afterwards. A change, a change of life. I find's interesting, because if we look at 2050 and we say that this is already on the shelves for 3-4 years, where could it move our population? I don't think it moves the population in general. I think it moves those we come to treat. Hopefully will move them from having depression to not having depression. A part of them. It's not all it will work for. I'm not sure it will have a positive effect on everyone. Some of us have experienced that they have gotten worse. A funny example can be that we were at a Western Ghetto meeting. We started this. All of us to run the study around the world, or the whole of Europe, met and discussed the study, and they said, we run a healthy volunteer study in London. If you want, you can be healthy volunteers. Then there are two thirds, apparently, for you get psilocybin, and there is a third for you get placebo. We would like to participate until you have tried it. You can just raise your hand. There was not one person who raised their hand. And I think it illustrates very well, a little conservatively, what a doctor is. I probably have that attitude. Out of the blue, I have a little fucked up life. I became a professor at the age of 40. You can't do that without taking a little bit of a break and maybe do some things in a certain way, and be a certain way. It can happen. I would like to have a clear view of what I have thought about. And I don't want that. I have a good life. I have a high quality of life. I am very happy with my work. So you have to consider when should use it, but it can have an effect on those who have it bad. I agree with that. I think we should be careful, because more and more people want to get started with this. I see that. I get more and more requests. I would also like to be careful, because you don't necessarily need to open up to notice everything that is in there. Do you need to notice after? And the people I can see, I also see some who get it worse. It's not everyone who gets it better. I think it would be a bit naive to think that 100% get it better. So I also see people who get it worse. And where I can see a common denominator, it's those who don't have a network around it. They start this process without any support, also because it's still taboo and stigmatized, as you felt when you were at the hospital, that you are suddenly seen differently. So when you go through these deep changes and you are suddenly seen differently, you may not have much support, then it's actually not that bad. And there are some who get more anxiety, become more depressed and get a worse quality of life. So it's not just something you just jump out of because you think it's just mega cool. And of course we should make such a program and say that people should think really well. Don't let them think that they will get a huge future shock. The only one who likes change is a wet baby. And think now if there was some drug, Lars, that could make you feel like you could be in change and say, everything is okay. No, I can't do the same thing I did yesterday, but I can do something new. I've also gotten some new brainwaves, René. But can't you already do that? Did you do the same thing you did yesterday? If you look back a year, did you do the same thing? Look how fantastically talented people were in Covid. If you have a strong enough burning platform, then you should probably move. In psychiatry, we really wanted to see our patients, and we were pretty pissed off.. We moved from having 85-95% of regular outpatient consultations to 97-98% virtual consultations in three days. You can easily move people if you have a strong enough motivation. I don't think there is a need for medical treatment to get them there. To get new traces. I don't know. I'm out at some places where I think they could use a new way. So if we think forward to 2050, I think there will be other interventions and other types of drugs. Do you think about psychedelics? Psych psychedelics. I think we will get other forms that are more optimized. The reason why we went from LSD to psilocybin is because you have a shorter time when it is active. It is much easier to handle in clinical practice. It is 8-10 hours instead of 18-24 hours. You will probably also be able to cut some other things away, optimize it, make it safer in different ways. So I think there will be some things. And there will probably be, things as we saw when SSRI came in the mid 90's. You got first a fluoxetine and then a MeToo-preparation for all the other companies, because they were always meant to make money. And that made good sense, then they have different ways of making their money, and you can probably see that here. I don't think that psilocybin is the only preparation that is launched from one company. I think there will be other companies that go the same way, if it turns out to be effective. And certainly the same on MDMA. I just want to ask you something. In 2050, we will see a greater dependence on this. How dependent is it if we look at psilocybin or MDMA? Psilocybin is not very dependent on the data we have. MDMA has a little blackened skin because it has probably created a psychological dependence. People have been very happy with the effect they have experienced, and then you take it again and again and again. It's not as dependent as morphine or heroin, where you get a physical reaction to it. But of course you could be worried about what would happen. Yes, I think so. Psilocybin is not a danger in relation to the fact that it becomes addictive, also because it is very hard to go through. You yourself mention that it is hard. You have almost a blocked brain afterwards, and that is not something you want to go out and do every weekend. But MDR can have a slightly different psychological effect. You want to get into that state of mind, that compassionate, mindfullness, beautiful feeling that we all belong together. And of course you have to take care of that. But I would say that I would be really, really sad if this becomes something that becomes performance enhanced drugs again. And something where we need more productivity. That's something I can be a little worried about with this society. Growth, growth, growth. We need to produce more, be more, do more, perform more. If this becomes another drug, another form of medicine, that can be taken either legally or illegally, that will make me perform better better, better, be better, then we have completely missed out on what the potential is with these medicines. But you just have to know that that's how humans are structured. If we get faster and better and longer, then this will just be a huge supertrend against 2050. So that's why Lars is asking, because that's what the story shows. I think there's a lot of money to be made if it works. There are 300-350 million people who are depressed. I think if it works, and you also have to see that it has a long-term preventive effect, could it be something you think is something we move forward with earlier, so we don't expect people to be very resistant, but maybe we will give it to people with multiple depressions already. These are things you will probably see over time. So I think it can get a fairly large market share in the long run, because it's a state that fills quite a lot. I think we should be more and more productive, but we spend less and less time working. So for that reason, I think in 2050 we might work a few hours, but maybe more intensely. Whether that's better, I don't know, but I think it's another way of working. Thank you very much for being here. One of the most ambitious visions for a future with psychedelic therapy comes from Rick Dublin, founder of the organization MAPS, which has been the world's most advanced research in the treatment of PTSD with MDMA. Dublin has stated that he sees a world facing Net Zero Trauma by 2070. A future where there is a balance between the amount of trauma that occurs in the world and the amount of trauma that becomes widespread. The vision is grand, but not utopian, because we all will experience trauma in life, also in the future. In the future, in 2070, we will treat trauma as a global priority, where education, prevention and advanced therapy will provide mental relief with the same efficiency and sense of urgency as when we go to the dentist, get blood tests or repair the screen on our phone. Well Lars, are you going to therapy? I don't think I need to, but I think it's really interesting, because the diseases we're talking about here are very often totally invalidating people's diseases, at least in certain periods. There are many people, as we just heard, 350 million people suffering from depression. Exactly. And depression is a thing. When you talk about depression, it's not necessarily about if something really bad has happened in your life and you get it really bad. It's about whether you get it really bad on an unnatural level or you also get it really bad without you being able to explain it or without there being any other explanation than that it's something inside yourself that doesn't work as well. So if you can help or remove it, plus all this long list of other things you can get with these types of medicine, where it sounds like the previous attempts are very promising. I imagine that you have been in a car accident and then you have to tell the police what happened, and then you have to go to the psychologist and the psychiatrist, and then you have to take some MDMA, and then you have to go to the psychologist and the psychiatrist and then you have to take some MDMA and then you have to go back and relive and then you get fixed. We're going to start the cycle. We're going to. Nice or need to have with this psychedelic medicine? We have managed fine without a period, you could say. I would share it and say it's need to have for those who have serious problems. For the whole society, it would be nice to have that you can help more people. How quickly is this developing? We have heard that for two to three years, so it's fast. It's incredibly fast. But that's after a long period of time. Then I would like to hear from you, who is it we should invest in? You have already been employed by some. I just had to take a look at it. Yes, the historical analysts say you just have to do what Peter Thiel does. But if there are companies, some pharmaceutical companies that come out with this approved and with patents behind it, then it is certainly a really good thing. I have invested in Lundbæk for the longest time. I I'm still waiting for something. Rich, sustainable, smart or healthy? Healthy. Isn't this a supertrend, even though it's a bit crazy? It's not an all-round supertrend as art and intelligence, but I think it's a supertrend and it's really important. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends.

No, it knows you. But it doesn't have the same knowledge base as you do. It's much more important.

This is Supertrends, the show where we are curious about all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrend who is a kind of a replica of Vietar. I've bought him the philosophy program and the big love coach package. And unlike my real husband, who is good enough to be a bit more skilled in French than usual, Kim develops with a rapid pace. Last time I visited the customer, I had forgotten to turn him off. Suddenly he took the word and proposed 5 measures that he thought would improve the supply chain in the future. And I was a bit of a headache because he came up with some pretty good ideas. This time it will be about the future of personal AI. Welcome to... Lars, before I give you the floor, I'd like to tell you about another episode I've had. I'm almost being attacked by these AI people at the moment. It was a Teams meeting, and I have a bot that takes notes of my Teams meetings. And it could remember that I had a meeting with the vocational high school. It had forgotten about it. The student took part in the meeting and the customer was very angry that I wasn't there. They started to talk in private and in the end they decided to put on the show. I get the whole story in, both about how angry they are at me and everything else. I actually felt that it was a bit of a borderline when I had been on a dutiful. But when I listen to you, Lars, you start saying, Personal AI, it's the future, it's the wildest future, and now it's coming. That's right. Right now we have about 3800 predictions for the future in Supertrends and I've had the honor of reading them all because I've rated them all for importance. So I told you that I think in the next few years, two, three, four years, I think if I have told you that I think that in the next few years, 2, 3, 4 years, if I have to choose one thing that will have a big influence on the world, it is actually Personal AI. And what is it that makes it Personal AI? Is it a new wife you want to have? Where is she? She has to do all these amazing things. It's a big need that I and many others see. If we think about our own lives, it stretches from everything to... The things you can think of, it's something that can help you organize practical tasks and make sure you remember your things. I also think it was annoying, that team spot. You could have called me and said, come to the meeting now. They are getting more and more angry now. But as it can virtually serve a computer, it can interact with the automation in your office, but it is much more, for example, you can have positive psychology in it in the way that you can have a conversation with it and say, I have started waking up at 2 am every night, what do you suggest I do? Sleep pills? No. Or, it's a bit of a challenge in my love life, there are some things that are really good, there are some things that don't really work, what should I do about it? And so on, as a conversation partner, it can also be your coach with I would like to lose 3 kilos or I would like to get in shape for a sports festival or something like that. And then it makes a program for you to follow up. And have you done it? And when you haven't done it, have you thought about what you could do to get better at following your program these things are things we know are of great interest, great demand and great need. It's a question of how you can do all of this without letting your personal information out. And there can also be something like, how do I get informed? I would like to have a personal AI to take care of, so I only get information about what I want to know, but in the format I want to have at the time I want to have. And I would like to do that too. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence, give a signal when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. Yes, so we take them next year here. We start with 2024, so Personal AI is integrated with what is called Augmented Reality, which is where you can see through goggles, glasses or a smart contact lens in the future. You see what people have always seen, but then there is a digital layout with information and pictures and so on. So it can talk to personal AI, so it's pretty fast. Then there will be that Personal AI can assist with health control and that over 50% of all existing Personal AI programs analyze what you do and what happens on social networks to help you give the right recommendations. So in 2025, Personal AI agents will appear who can provide emotional support and can be a kind of virtual guide, coach, trainer, motivator, psychologist for you. Personally I can get personalised people. For example when I drive a car and I have GPS, I have chosen someone with an indian dialect. That's nice. I don't know if there is anything. I have completely forgotten that it is strange. Then people come in and sit in my car and look at me. Personal AI is able to serve a computer, a virtual computer. That means they can go in and solve some of the tasks they would have done with a computer. They can provide personal decision support. They can perform as real experts in many areas. So they are able to register your emotional state, especially if it is a little extreme, if you are deeply depressed or something like that. And then take into account that in the way they support you. And they can help with your personal finances. Then comes 2026, that they have algorithms that predict your needs, and that even thought about it, they can say, have you thought about going on vacation for a week, you don't have any suitcases or anything. 10% of all portable technology, that is smartwatches, smart glasses and so on, also all those fitness trackers, that they integrate with personal AI. That is, for example, if you track your steps or track your pulse and so on, then the information you have about you is integrated and can in this way give you better advice. In 2027, Personal AI will be able to reconstruct mental images, meaning that it understands what is happening in your brain, especially if it is connected to the brain computer interfaces. And then you have to listen to our program about reading thoughts. You have to. And then in 2028, you have Personal AI that can run your household, and that is your household machines, if you have automatic vacuum cleaners and so on. But not the children? No, probably not the children. And then in 2029, a personal agent who knows everything about your life, you can ask him to start writing a autobiography. That's actually an interesting thought. With pictures it has taken with the pro camera. And then in 2032, 20% of the OECD population has deeper relationships with an AI agent than with humans. I'm not that excited about that. It was so nice, we talked to some children, Lars, some small school children about their performance. They thought it was very unpleasant that you might come to believe that there was a human in the other end. And now we have just talked to him, Vice President from Universal Robot, who also thinks that towards 2050 we will treat machines as machines and not as humans. Yes, it must be clear for us what the difference is. But we just have to remember that today there are a lot of people who have a closer relationship to their pet than to other people. There are also people in the virtual world who have a closer relationship to people they never see than to the people they see. So on that background, I would say that if you say that in 2032 20% of all investors have a closer relationship to their personal AI than to some people, it doesn't seem unrealistic to me. When personal AI assistants become freely accessible, it opens up for a wide range of radically new possibilities and challenges. Here are two of each. A personal AI will increase our productivity by managing our calendars, automating repetitive tasks and supplying us with real-time data that helps us navigate complexity. A personal AI will gradually structure relevant knowledge for us in a way that makes re-education a natural and meaningful part of everyday life that is very sweet to the individual. But in the future, as we get used to the personal AI, we also risk feeling dependent on it for daily tasks and even small decisions. And then we risk, at the end, to experience social isolation, as it becomes necessary to seek safety and care in daily digital contact instead of challenging human interactions. Kasper Juel, you are CEO and co-founder of Kin.ai and you are a mentor at MIT Sandbox Innovation Lab. Welcome. Thank you for having me. Lars has made it clear that you will be our best friend in 32, at least 20% of us. What do you think? I think there were many good prognoses. I think we will fall more into the virtual support. We work on a personal intelligence that understands you and you can rely on. Especially the last part, in terms of building trust between robots and humans. Tell us about this KIND project. What are your dreams of creating? Basically, we started out by saying that we would like to have people own their own data and get the value out of it. That was the basic idea. If we can become more self-sufficient in our everyday life, where we are not affected by the media and the online interactions that are very biased at the moment. Can you give some examples of how we are affected and driven around in Malaysia? Now Snap has created an AI for our children. And that's what you want to be an antidote to, I assume. Or how do you think? I think there are many elements to that. Because as a starting point, we think that the incentive model on the internet is very focused on big tech monetizing more. And that's the sad thing about that the users are never really focused. And it becomes a bigger and bigger problem when you start running artificial intelligence for a year, then you can't really move the boundaries very much. And it's hard to say how it actually ends. But I think I want to look more towards... It's something we decide ourselves. Aren't you the one who should create something we want to have, where we can be empowered and get the power back and over our own data, but at the same time be lifted and enlightened? Yes, definitely. And it's a bit back to what Lars said about human-human connection and people who have better relationships with their cat or dog. I think it's very interesting to look at how people interact with each other and what it is that pushes us forward, where artificial intelligence at the moment is very productive, but we don't look so much into what is driving that productivity and where we want it to go with our lives. So with our lives. So our focus is to help people make better decisions for themselves. So long-term decisions? It's about, for example, the knowledge trap. There are many different things that make us not necessarily good at making decisions. People themselves are good at advising others, but not so good at looking into things. That's why we have mentors, coaches and psychologists. I'm one of the lucky ones who can be an access to that, but not everyone has that. So if we can democratize access to knowledge about yourself, you can make better decisions for your life. That sounds really good. It costs a couple of money, a couple of thousand kroner with such a good coaching. Yes, it does. If you are now happy with a kind bot, can you then jump over with all your data somewhere else or is it the one who comes first who wins this? Yes, you can do that as a starting point well. We have built it up around the user owning their own data. And you can move that data wherever you want. It's a digital wallet that can contain all your credentials and all your other information, as you can see EU is coming out with now. So if you want to use it, you can use it use it, others you have to sell it. But you can of course say that your personal AI is something you build over a long period of time. And that's why we think you should own and control it. Because let's say you, for example, where you spend more years building this assistant up that knows you and that understands when it should interact with you, when it should to interact with you in the supermarket. If suddenly there are others who can turn it off, how does that work? And that's why we need to get back to ownership and control should be with the user. It's simply the most important thing. And the most important thing is that we look at these things now instead of looking at them later. And do I ignore my deceased avatar, because I don't want to have it in my door. With them, I would like to keep having access to their memories, because it's a form of photo album. I can say with Kim there, my replica avatar. The reason for the extended subscription is actually because we have a lot of pictures and stories together. It's my diary of what's going on. That's why I can't let him go when it gets too late. It's not because of the suggestions he has for the supply branch. I think you could see that. There's definitely a possibility. I I think we are all looking for information. As Lars says, knowledge is available everywhere. And we would like to have the figures that can help us along the way. Whether it is your grandfather or a philosopher or whatever, it is only nice that you can use that knowledge. Kasper, you need to explain to me before we go to 2050. You want to do it privately and Lars gets his private data and I have mine. But what artificial intelligence is good at is that we have access to all data and we can scrape a lot of data and experiences from others, so we build on other people's experiences and other patterns. How do you do that while ensuring privacy? We are working with new technologies. It is clear that something called decentralized web nodes helps us to get back to data ownership. We are working with a new form of Trusted Execution, Cloud, which can run the GPU computational LLM. It can be very technical, but in the end it just means that the data you train the model on, you own 100%. We don't have access to anything. We can never see your data. But then you can't even go in and protect me against it suddenly giving me some not so reasonable information. We've seen it before with people who are depressed, and then they feed a lot of negativity into their bot, and suddenly it are told where the way to the nearest bridge is. Of course, we work with these LLM models where we go in and fine-tune them according to their needs. I think it's an important topic you point out because they have to be trained against both more empathy and understanding. And it's a bit like, yes, understanding. It's a knowledge resource, but it also needs to have self-doubt in it, so you can work with it. And that's our job, in terms of how we work with these models. So we have that responsibility. Do you think there will ever be a business model here? We usually get everything for free because we see our data. And if we don't see our data anymore, where is the model then? Yes, we are used to getting it for free. I think we are on the way away from free, if I'm being honest. People use more paid apps because they are better. I believe a a cost-efficiency ratio. I believe we pay for storage, we pay for the utility we want. I would rather have 5 apps that I use all the time than 100 that I get for free. I think that's not a problem. We want to have our data safe, especially our health data, financial data, personal data. Imagine that you start telling about your relationship to your children and your husband and so on. It's data that we want to keep to ourselves. You also see that many of these journaling apps are becoming much more private and so on. And that's a good reason for it. Also messaging for that matter. What is the difference between digital assistants that most most people know today, Siri and Alexa, and future personal AI? First and foremost, it is the complexity of interactions. Where the assistants of today are more like a kind of programmed response machines, the assistants of the future are in far higher degree intelligent leaders who constantly learn and remember. In 2050 your personal AI will therefore function more as a collaboration partner than an assistant. It will understand your feelings and values, function as your closest advisor And now we have to look at 2050 in relation to this personal AI. Will we get out of these ego chambers or will we walk around with a bot that always confirms us and puts us on an ever-long course of self-develop course and we slowly lose interest in others and society. How do we ensure that it is our interest? Who sets the long-term goals? You do it yourself. It's a lot about how you want to live your life, but it's hard to reach. I think a lot of people set goals for themselves and have proof of what values they want to live for, but it's hard to follow them. It's easy to see it from the outside and see it from others, but it's hard to see inside. So it's a support to live the life you want and make the decisions that help you. Can I, like with Netflix, get a family membership so that it can also control my mother? I would love to be in a group with her if she can help me tell me what she wants for her birthday gift. As a starting point, I think at the moment we are typing into an interface, but it is clear that we believe a in speaking, because it is the spoken language we have always used to understand each other, communicate and help each other. And we see that as the future. That means that you will be able to speak from agent to agent at some point. And then you can also get to know what she wants. And then you have to say that you can talk to each other, like when you transfer pictures to another phone. There has to be something to it that we give them permission to not just come to make family meetings before they get home. Absolutely. And it's a bit back to this control element, because we feel that you have to decide and it's you who gives access to your data and can be used for different things. And it's also certain that there are users who would like to give their data away to make the models better. There is also a right to that. But it's you who has to decide. And it's the same thing with self-sovereignty. Self-sovereignty is about you deciding, and you deciding over your own. I have donated my... or at least my request to 23andMe, and I have received some very nice gene cards back, and I get to know what's going on. But I have chosen to donate it. I am also a future researcher and a. How many people do you think will donate their data? Because you need something critical. We don't have access to data. We can't see data. We work with simulated data, with user interviews. We work in many different ways in the app to understand what is good feedback and what is bad feedback. And the users can always share with us what they want to help us to build it better. It's just the basic premise that is incredibly important to us. Instead of it being the other way around, it's about the user first. But if we then go in and ask what the future is for macroeconomic analysis, which is something completely different, then personal AI also comes up, because one of the prognoses says that if people are willing to let go of the algorithms that their personal AI has made anonymized, that is, you do not know who it is, but you have their data, and if you get 1000 or 2000 or 10,000 of them, then you have a good representation of how the population acts and thinks. And then you can see how the population will react if you make one or the other economic decision. And when I had a corresponding, or we had, in the future of marketing, it turns out that in marketing you do a lot of what you call group discussions, where you have a group of buyers or consumers, they sit around a table and then it is presented for a hypothetical product. Group of consumers. Yes, a user group. And then they say what they want to say about it. And what came out was that you can actually do that with personal AI. And that means instead of having to arrange that some people come into a place, you have that software that runs non-stop and reacts to everything. You can use it for media analysis and political analysis. You can have it running where there is a political discussion, then there are 1000 or 10,000 of these models. And then you can see from the sum of them, almost the speedometer for how good or bad it can be what this politician said just now, etc. What do you think of that? I think it sounds very interesting. I think it's more about whether people have given access to that data. Because you can use it in many different ways. I think it's an interesting phenomenon we're looking into, where agents can come together. There are different examples of that. It will be a possibility in the future that they can act for us on the internet. And that's also something we're working towards. But again, back to that it has to be done in the right way. I think you have a lot of things in the future in relation to us, and different prognoses in general, a better understanding of people. It comes because it is a data collection in the way it is. I could think about asking you, now you are sitting as a young person, you have personal but, which is extremely clever. Then you can get some scenarios for example, what can I become? Or it helps you, supports you in visualizing different ways. So you get a lot of potential options. Yes, there are two parts to it. There is decision fatigue in relation to a lot of decisions. We ran a course at CBS where we worked on use cases for a person in AI that was actually very interesting. But of course there are many students who do not know't know how to focus their time and it was actually a huge use case to find out, okay, I want this in my life, it's the goal I have, I just have a hard time getting there. So I think there was a lot of that. I think when you start to mention that you are setting up a lot of scenarios, I don't think it's important to set up a lot of scenarios. I think it's more about saying about saying, this is what you want to do. If you have a goal with it, if you have values that are about you, then you can be guided better there. And you can understand the consequences of your choice. And that's what I think is super interesting. When I have a big decision that I have to make about something work-wise, I always go to friends or acquaintances or family. Some understand me on a business side, but they also understand me personally. So it's aligned with what you want and your needs. And then I can make a decision. I think that's the help we don't have and many would like to benefit from. Yes, because now I'm a mother myself and you have some own opinions and it's all about being a guide and listening coach. And we are not all family members who are good at that. Do you use an avatar today to let you guide with, besides friends and family? No, not at the moment. I play a lot with them. So you just want to give it to us others? I use our own, I can tell you. Oh, that's good. I'm privileged to have had the opportunity to have a performance coach and a psychologist who help me in the decisions. But it's a lot of what I think could be really, really fantastic and democratize over against a lot of other people other people. We have also made programs about a quantum computer and so on. It's about having different parallel lives. Because it could be that you as a starting point think you want to be something. But that's just because you haven't played with the other scenarios yet. So I can imagine that it will be interesting as a simulation as well. Why spend five years to find out, then you got there, then it wasn't what you wanted anyway. Can it help you out in the future, such a personal AI 2050? It's a hard, fine We're back to whether you want to have too many opportunities or too few opportunities, and how we as humans and nature are in relation to many opportunities. But I would still say that there are many who need to get a better understanding of where they end. Now I know myself well enough, I only read about financing at CBS, because my father read. And in reality I would have done something else, even in Asia and the USA and so on, but then I got the advice later. But I think so. But you're right, you shouldn't have hundreds of different things that confuse us even more. And we already have that decision paralysis in relation to how many decisions we have to make in our lives. One can say that what an AI can help with is maybe removing some of these trivial tasks that we use a lot of mind-span on and focusing on using our time and energy on what is important to us. But how proactively do you imagine that a person with AI actually goes in and pokes you in the shoulder and says, try this, it might be your goal for the next two years to lose those five kilos, but if you think ten years from now, your children will still have thanked you for eating boiled eggs. Yes, that's very interesting. Because as a sponsor, we also talk a lot about how we have to train all the time and be in good shape. But you can also notice that I train more to play with my children than I train just to train because you have to. So there is a bigger future perspective to keep going with that. But that's right, and I think it's super interesting. As a starting point, we start with you getting feedback on your actions and you can get a better insight into what it is. But of course, the more it lets you know, the more it will also like to give you insights into your life, how you can do it better. And it's all connected. It's also incredibly fun to look at something like sleep, for example. It's really a barrier for a lot of people to achieve the things they want. Lars has control over sleep. I have a little less control over sleep. And I have less control. Okay, so it's all the way around. But it's to say that there is something about sleep that affects you in other things in your life. That is, what is it that you really need to work on? And that's what a coach would do for you to start with. Okay, so it's a bit of the thin model. So there is one of those boards where the water just fuzzles out And it identifies the artificial intelligence with the same. It's right there. We can see that on your patterns. If you fix this, there is something else you can catch. So it's your personal DJ. Yes, a little. I feel like a generation that had all the possibilities in the world. We still feel that we have it. Therefore, it's hard to make decisions about which direction to go. And the directions you want, if you want it enough, it also requires some consequences. And it's clear that that's the way it is, but it's hard to make those decisions. How crazy is this, Kasper? In 2050 we'll drop out of school, you don't want to study finance, you'd rather have your bot explain sociology and then a little finance, enough to start a business, but you also get all the other parts that you need to succeed in this puzzle game. I saw that Solomon, who wrote The Big Wave from OpenAI, says that within the next five years we will have what is called Artificial Capable Intelligence. It can help you create shops and businesses and all sorts of things. It can help you identify what exactly is missing to succeed in this business And then there is no reason to learn all sorts of things. Then you can get the puzzle pieces you need to use. Will we get there in 2050? Yes, I think we will. In my head, and I have worked on several different things, this is the biggest thing I have ever worked on. And is no doubt that when you talk about the wave, you are talking about converging technologies and societal impact. I have been a part of blockchain for a long time and it is clear that what I can see now is that it lacks societal impact and it will probably come at some point, but AI is so comprehensive because it has so many positive consequences for us as humans. So I have no doubt that we will all have a personal AI. I have no doubt that society will change radically, at least 2050. Whether it will go as fast as we think it will, I think we are also in a hype cycle, to be honest. But of course it will go fast. And I think Lars' prognoses will probably go faster than you think. I also want to ask about something else. There is a lot of inequality in society today. And now you said democratization. And we have also seen with artificial intelligence that it is the weak that are most lifted, because they have the greatest lifting potential and they are very, very capable. And that means there is a huge potential in this democratization. It's not just a word, it's really that you can lift, I'm just saying, Indian street children, rich Chinese and you name it, they just need access to these systems, then they can actually achieve some fantastic things and get along. So what will it mean to get equality on the globe against 2050? Well, it will mean a lot. I think it's also exciting to look at that earlier we got, you know, then you got the computer and the internet, it has made us really productive, we can a lot more, we work a lot more. There were future forecasts 50 years ago that said we would work much less today than we actually do. But we still work incredibly hard. It's interesting to look at whether artificial intelligence is actually what changes it. Because it is an intelligence that can take on so many different things. If we come to the new Turing test and what is it called in relation to... But we still have to choose. We get all those choices, so I can imagine that we will need 60 hours of it. So take the choices, do you think? Yes, make the choices, put one foot in front of the other, start the right project. What is it we want to create? Two elements in it. One is that you want to live the life you want to live. And the other thing is to bring people out into a better life. And it is clear that the more you can automate, the more you can... Something like UBI, Universal Basic Income, how will it start to be implemented when I start to get jobs and so on. So there are a lot of thoughts that can be implemented in the future. But you have created a personal AI, so it's yours. I don't think it's about that much. The AI will also be democratized when knowledge comes from a means, yes, you can influence it to a certain extent, but it's not because you and your people are ten times richer than everyone else. I couldn't imagine that. Maybe your people. Maybe your people. I don't know. No, it's that distinction again, Kasper. Then we might all become just as smart. Yes. Then no one is really smart. Or are we all smart? That's it. But aren't we only smart relative to others? No, it's not a win-lose game. It's win-win. The more smart people, the better it is for all people. According to my opinion. Yes, I would also say that we also have ... Humanity also has a lot of things that we need to stand up to over the next 50 years, at least that's what I've also made a statement about. So I think there's a lot of need for smart people who come together and find solutions to the societal challenges we have. And I think that artificial intelligence can help to augment this in a really good way would like to add something to the point from Universal Robots. We talked to them and they said that it is a problem to make personal AI and it becomes a kind of person and it makes voices. Lars would like to have an Indian GPS. Should we try to get it in another form and call it a machine and a technology, and make it something human? Have you thought about that in relation to the personal AI? I agree that it is a way to the heart, stomach and head to communicate with another person. I think it should be human. I think it is about building as many human imprint as possible, because it is the trust that makes us trust them. Again back to who owns them and who makes decisions based on them. As long as you control the ownership of your property, it's fine. But if a state suddenly has access to all your residents' personal AIs, then you have another challenge. So it's very important. But don't you think it's a problem that 20% get married with their own AIs and drop a man with a beard and drop a man full of meat and blood? We have this loneliness epidemic in the US where 8 out of 10 people feel lonely. And as Lars said earlier, those who are best friends with their cats. We have some challenges. That's what I was trying to say. In society there are some challenges at the moment. It may be that we are talking about making better decisions in the supermarket, but we have some fundamental challenges. One thing is one thing, which we could change a lot. I suddenly get a crazy thought. Inspired by the fact that I have a GPS guide myself, who speaks with an indian accent. What would you say to the fact that it deepfakes your own voice? Would that be a good thing or a bad thing? If I were to talk to myself... It's your own voice that gives you the advice. Do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing? Is that what they call schizophrenia? I think it's very confusing, to be honest. And there's also a lot of talk about this with a second brain and a representation of yourself. I think it's very important that we don't see it as a representation. It's not us. Your AI is not you. It can be. No, it knows you. But it doesn't have the same knowledge base as you. It knows you very well. That's the most important thing. It shouldn't be you, otherwise you'll be confused. I think you're right, but it's interesting, the prognosis of choosing a personality for it. I would like to be a ghost in the studio. Whether Whether it's a strict school teacher or a nice person whispering in your ear or whatever you want to call it. I have just read the biography of Elon Musk and his father was so bad to him and kicked him and humiliated him and everything else. So it might be a real Satan you should have if you really want to perform. Or what, Kasper? I'm not sure about that. He succeeded, that's for sure. He definitely succeeded. No, I'm not sure about that. I don't know if the goal is to produce a billion Elon Musk's. I don't know. You just have to look back and say that he is our time's Da Vinci. He started many companies. I have actually thought about going around with a personal AI already. That's why he's doing these 5-6 companies. I'm sure he's on the front line? But I would say he was curious. He dared to make decisions. He has taken some crazy jumps in going into both EV and R. And he has seen the connection between them. I think he has been inspired or pressured to do these things, but he has really focused on a very scientific focus. I don't think everyone can experience it the same way. What I think is interesting is that he has this new diversity with his autism. That means he may not have been able to understand what people need, but then he went very analytical and said, what does society need? Well, it needs an electrified fleet of cars that can drive itself. We need a butler at home. If we can fix that we can move on to Mars, then we have a plan B, two possibilities to solve all these things with energy transition and how we plant and do what we do, and then we can import all these good ideas to the earth. And then he simply goes out of there with all these goals. But I just have to say that now I am myself a future researcher, but I have been pretty bad at taking my own future medicine and I am a little more laissez faire and also just go after a gut feeling and who can I be good at being with and then something new arises and arises, and something else. I could probably be a little longer by going proactively to work instead of just lifting the phone, for example, and go to the parties I'm invited to. But who is it that meets that strategy? It depends on what it means to be a little longer, right? Because mean to you? What is your goal in life? God, he was already a coach. We have to train on one side. He takes off his glasses. If your goal is to be more productive and run businesses, as Lars has, and that's fantastic, then we all have the same goal. If we now see that it is the Health Board that should finance this, that we all should have our private, now we are talking about having a Danish LLM model. Maybe we should instead invest in that all Danes get their own personal AI and that would be the big change. And then we could show the rest of the world that we have a privacy solution that works and we can lift all Danes by at least 20 IQ points thanks to this. So it would be good if the health authorities had some intentions for how productive we should be. Yes, I think it's fantastic. Health plays a big role in our lives. And of course, it will always do so. So I think it's a really, really good idea. In relation to the Danish model, I think it's also good that they work towards it. But of course, it has to come from somewhere. We have also talked to many companies to see if there was a use case in building an agent that could interact with companies. But I think we should start somewhere else. I think we should start with the individual and understand the value it can create. Can this remove misinformation, for example? There is misinformation everywhere. We can't agree on what's up and down. Can it solve that? It becomes a very important person in your life. Yes, and then we go in and look at these models and how they are trained. We of course also work with open source models. But it is clear that when you build the models, you have to build a database on the side that can verify the queries quite easily, compared to some data you have access to. But it is clear that it is a challenge. You can say that their approach and our approach is also to make the interface you interact with more curious and more self-aware about that it does not always have answers. So I think there are more ways to go there, but it is clear that something needs to be solved. And then I think about how it will affect our real personal relationships. Will I be better with other people? Or do I not dare to? Because they are so rude, because they are used to talking to those personal AI's. They have dropped everything about thanks and do you want to be cute? And then there are just some prompts in my head and then I say, no, I drop it. We hope so. Who sees it as a 20-50? What about our socialization? You still have to see it as a support from you. And that's why control is very important. It's not someone who takes over for you. I think our relationships will get better. It could be that you can coach us in how you are better in your relationships. That's what many people want. It's personal relationships that make it better. It could be that we laugh at online dating when it came out, but you have to admit that I don't know if it's 70% of the relationship that is created because of it. So there is something in relation to getting better and using technology to create better human to human connection. It's clear that we see AI becoming this size that becomes AI to human connection that can help in the same way and help more because there are many people who don't have access to this. There are many people who are lonely, there are many people who don't have the opportunity or means to achieve this. So now you are out in 2050. All this personal AI has succeeded and it has succeeded in the, because Lars says it will go pretty fast. What has happened to social changes? What do you think are the biggest changes? What has surprised us the most? I think we are surprised by how easy it is to tie the bond to artificial intelligence. I think we will build a very close bond to those who support us and understand us in this way. Many people would like to be heard and seen, and artificial intelligence can do that at that time. So I think it will be extremely interesting. Then there is all this brain-com interface, which is very interesting in terms of how you combine your own intelligence with artificial intelligence. But I think it will be a natural flow between interacting with people as well as interacting with machines. So, hearing. I think there are a lot of good things about hearing, to be honest. I don't know if I think everyone should have a romantic relationship to an AI, but if it helps people, then there is nothing wrong with it. What is interesting to hear is that at some point she goes in and reads through all his earlier publications and collects all the best through years, 20 years, collects it, sends it to a place that can publish it and actually makes a book for him about his life. And that act in itself is just so fantastic if you think they've gone through what it takes to make it happen. So I think there are many positive things we hear and that mindset. What is the biggest dilemma you will face? Privacy, I think. I think it will be a challenge if we don't get control of these things to start with. I think it will be difficult if we... Now the EU is very pro-regulation and in the USA I think it will be more for the users and they will push more on privacy because as you mentioned with Snapchat, it becomes more apparent how much our minds are affected by these different services. So I think it's something that needs to be controlled and then to build more understanding into the models so we don't think it's a fact, everything that comes out. They should also be self-critical in a way, and I think that's really important. How fast will it go? It will go fast, but as I said earlier, I think we are in a hype cycle, so I think that hype is falling a little, but I still think the development is still going on. It will be quick. 2050, there is a long way to go. A lot can happen. Thank you for your time, Kasper. Thank you for having me. Imagine a future where your best friend is the artificial intelligence in your ear. It never complains about your bad jokes, it always listens to your problems and it tells the chatbot of the café how you prepare your coffee before you are tired. Your personal AI never forgets the days of the day, or what ice you drink, or what that song from the 80's is called that you like. And even if it can never really replace a real treat, it can bring a smile to the face, help you make the most environmental-right decision, and remind you to eat the vitamin pill. And I think everyone who has listened to it can hear that. And I have also, apart from reading all the prognoses we have made in Supertrance Machine and thinking, hold on, it's huge. So I have also been a little bit in touch with it myself, because I am co-writer of a book called Backlåg – 50 hacks for adult life and it's about positive psychology and coaching. I wrote it together with a co-writer and then we got in touch with someone who had started a company in the field of artificial intelligence. And then we came to the conclusion that we should make this book about a chatbot, that is, someone you could talk to. And that's what they did. Lærke, my co-writer, and one of the people from the company worked together for about 40 hours to get it to work. Then Lærke wrote me an email where it says, Hi Lars, you have written some books. Would you like to make some others about chatbots? Then I write how long it takes for each. About a quarter. That was quick. Then I think there maybe I should train more on them afterwards. Can you also make podcasts about chatbots? You can do anything you want. Everything you can make yourself about a chatbot. I still think 60 hours of super trends in a chatbot could be very cool. Yes, that could be done. Come in a quarter. But just about that case, it's about how to deal with personal challenges where you don't really know what the answer is because you don't have a proper model device and it's hard to understand yourself compared to others and so on. And we know there is something called children's telephone and there are different other services in Denmark. You can also book a time at a psychologist or a psychiatrist if you get a reference maybe. But there is a half and a whole year's waiting time for that in Denmark example. Most of the calls to the child psychologist or the child telephone come at odd times and I think that 70% is not answered because it is overloaded and so on. There is a very, very high need for it. It is actually my introduction to this. It is on all possible plans there is a great need. For example, with education. School is a kind of industrial machine based on a little-adult-casse-thinking. Everyone comes in here and they sit and get the same education. But people are very different. Children are very different. And adults too, when they are supposed to well. Then came the Khan Academy, where you could get special instructions. It was really good, and it was a snackable mini-education. But of course, if you have something like the Khan Academy integrated into your personal AI, it will find out what it is you can't find out, and then find out how it will guide you. So that means that the teaching will probably get much better. It will be as if everyone has a helper, what is it called? A helper? A little geogarly. A tutor. Everyone has their own personal tutor. And it's not just about education, but also about personal things, about training, about health, about love, and so on. I think that the most important thing about this is that it can become your social bond. People have conflicts today, they are cutting each other out. But we can only solve world problems together. And we have to work better through the branches of personality types. And it goes wrong again and again. It's the whole story about the Babel Tower, an old story. People go to war with each other. Imagine if... The Russians love their children too. Now it's going to be YouTube-like. Imagine if we could be helped to find peace and a common picture of what would be best for everyone. Imagine if we had enough insight to not suboptimize and believe. I'm a little bit provoked by Kasper with what is your goal? What is your goal? What is my goal if I can see it in full with others, not just with my children, but also with my country and the world as a whole. Then it would be nice if I calibrated where I am so tired of going. And I really think it will be a game changer, this personal area. I think so too. Psychologists say that you can't change your personality very much, but you can change your mentality extremely much. And what it can do is help you to be solution-oriented in every aspect, including conflicts. So the big difference in poverty and wealth is in reality what kind of culture you get from your parents and from your surroundings, more than what kind of economic background, I think. That means if you can help everyone, regardless of what they grew up in, by getting a better culture background, a better, more solution-oriented mentality, and a growing mentality and so on, then it will also be something that have a lot of direct social consequences. There are so many ideas that arise when you listen to this conversation, for example dating. You can have personal AIs, like the parents in India find out who to marry. Then these personal AIs can talk to each other. They can date each other. And then they can find out who is a match. But I would also say on a macro level, Tesla has AIs. It's really a pang-dang to personal AIs just about how to drive a car. But the car doesn't drive by itself, it's driven by a person. And what Tesla does is that everything it learns is uploaded to a collective database. And then you find out which patterns are important. And then they take the most successful carers, for example those who never drive into something. They are then targeted by everyone. That means if you have thousands of AI's that upload, where you can upload collective experiences, then you find out, maybe there are some things that psychologists say you should do. Maybe there are some things that psychologists or coaches say you should do, but it turns out you don't have to. Because it doesn't work so well with those who do it. Just like you discovered that flies were a good thing just by looking at enormous amounts of data. There was a place where people couldn't get holes in their teeth. I found out that it was because there were flies in the water. So you will find out about everything on the macro plan. Is Personal AI nice or neat to have? Neat. We have lived really well so far. Super nice. Slow or fast in terms of moving around the way we usually live? It may be a hype cycle, but I mean very fast. I also think it's super fast. Difficult or difficult to invest in? Now we have a company here that has just received a proper capital boost. Is it moving forward? Is it to identify who is in charge? There are both start-ups and large master-dont companies that are starting it, so it's easy to invest in. Rich, sustainable or clever? All three. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends.

But it's clearly something that will come to fill more and more, because it is motivating. And it is a way of being in development. It's to call it a Mischief thing. It's a generational thing to do and call it that. Denmark and Albania are the only countries that do not have IT Education as a permanent of the public school. It's really great strength that you're up against as a child when you're in these games. Yes, it's one of the worst investments I've ever made in my life. This is Supertrends, the show where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by population. And that is games and gaming. And therefore it must be an essential part of the future. Not only as entertainment and career as we see with esports, but also as a powerful trend that will shape our way of working, shopping and our whole coexistence towards 2050. With us in the studio we have two experts who will help us understand how gaming and esports will drive technological progress, but also how they will always affect our relationships. Welcome to Supertrends. I got a cold turkey Right when my son was confirmed, I found out that he had spent 32.500 kroner on my husband's credit card. So some small amounts he had spent over a period of three years. And I find out that there is VDK on the account, but I don't find out that it's Playstation. And that my husband finds out. I don't think it was my fault. But I'm happy to transfer that money to my husband. And then I call Playstation and it's very bad. And I can hear that they have many angry mothers who call daily and say that it's not a problem at all, we can slowly refund the fee, you just have to call the police. And he was just 15 months old two months ago and I definitely didn't want him to get anything on his penalty. I will also been allowed to say it now, and he actually wants a Playstation 5, and I enjoy that he doesn't have a Playstation right now. But he has come out of it, he has a girlfriend, he has a job, he has a nice student and exams and such, so it hasn't taken away from him. But I see it as interesting and exciting as a future researcher, and since then I have been a great student, so it wasn't a bad thing for him. But I saw interesting and exciting things as a future researcher. Since then I have really had a huge eye opener in relation to how much money is at stake and how many feelings are at stake in it. But Lars, have you invested in all that gaming and esports? Yes, it is one of the worst investments I've ever made in my life. I invested in something called Fundcom, quite a lot. I didn't really notice that I suddenly became the biggest shareholder. And that was because there were all kinds of analysis about it, and they came up with a new game that had the potential to become a billion dollar game. And when they finally came up with it, Age of Conan, I tried to translate it, people were very excited, but then they went into action after a few steps in the game. And then was controlling my whole boardroom. It was actually the worst single investment in a company I have ever made in my life. As a future researcher, I talked a lot about these game abuses. Then there were so many meetings and I just found out, we have a huge blind spot. Our children live a life we don't know. So after that I started to nerd out a lot about gaming. And I also think it's fantastic that you can create so much adrenaline and passion about something that you want to spend so many hours on every day, because otherwise there are so many other boring places in your everyday life. Yes, I visited one of my friends the other day, and he had a gaming room where there are five super cool identical gaming chairs and five workstations, or what you call gaming stations. And that's until they go they go into a team, and then they sit in a team of five and play Crowd Strike. Land parties. And it looks totally like a war room, and then you can see that there's something cool there. We have two daughters, and one is completely uninterested in gaming, and the other loves gaming. Should we go to the timeline? We can do that. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives a clue to when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into play. That's right, and we have just found out that we have run 75,000 AI prompts and queries to give the experts a briefing, which is based on AI and edited. So this is something from gaming, very focused on esports, which is the cross-section of gaming as a hobby and sports as something that is also a business. But in 2024, an esports recruiting app will be launched, that is talent recruiting within esportsports. It's a sign that a new industry is starting to get in the right direction. 2025 the biggest prize for winning an esports competition will be 45 million dollars. So that's something called Land of Heroes. Then in 2025, it is estimated that there are 641 million, strange, not round numbers, 641 million who follow or play esports. The same year, we estimate that about 45% of it is mobile. And there is a trend towards mobile. There is something about it being completely overrated, a boy's man's sport. Not if you look at girls on mobile. Yes, that's what I would like to point out. It's similar very obvious thing. Not if you watch girls on mobile phones. Yes, that's what I wanted to emphasize. On mobile phones it's more of a small proportion. Then in 2027 a big media company makes a real-time game that synchronizes with something that happens live live on TV. So you can see a live event and play in that event. I imagine you can drive in the car of F1. But the other cars are the real cars that are on the track right now. Then there is 2027, I'm counting on it, there will be another game that will get over 100 million sales. That is, it will be sold in over 100 million... What is it called? Abonnements or licenses. And just from the perspective of Tetris, which has sold 520 million. Minecraft, 238 million. Grand Theft Auto V, 175 million. Lizzy Lotte, just to put it into perspective. It's a teaching program on how to steal cars, which sold 175 million. So very well built. In 2028, a leading film, which is artificial intelligence intelligence will automatically be converted into a computer game. It requires AI to be a bit smarter than it is now, but we're close to that. There is also something parallel to that. People can game about something that is in a movie and the result of what happens when they play the game affects how the movie plays out. For example, it's probably a splatter movie, I can imagine, with a lot of violence and stuff. And then who wins in these virtual fights that they play in the future, that's also what happens in the? That's what happens in the movie. You can play games without having all the software on your own console. It can be out in the sky. Which is not available, which is in real data centers around the world. It's a real computer, it just doesn't stand in front of anyone like it. The problem is that it requires a lot of data transport back and forth in real time, with very little deceleration. But then you expect that the technological capabilities are so great that over 50% of all gaming happens on the sky is so high. And then in 2030, they're going to calculate that the visual quality in computer games will be on par with the visual quality in the best computer animated movies today. If you've seen the best computer animated movies today on a high resolution screen, you can see that it is a real pain in the ass. I think it will be really fast. Yes, so you expect to get up to 20-30 and at the same time you expect that the virtual reality headsets you wear have 8K and that is means ultra high resolution. So it becomes very realistic to look at. In 2030, there are a lot of sports programs in the US. Most universities in the US also have an e-sports program. Maybe they also have chess clubs, but esports is so big, so they need it. And then in 2033, instead of having a goggles virtual reality headset, you can simply have contact lenses on, which gives you these interactive experiences. That's good, because I've tried sitting with those Oculus and they're really heavy and you get tired of them. Yes, around your neck, get rid of it. Then in 2035, 90% of all games will be played on many different platforms. It's called cross-platform integration. Then in 2035, there will be a lot of projects. There will be small projects in different things you go around with. You can have a button in your shoulder, so it becomes a video project. If there is a white wall in front of you, it will suddenly become a screen. You can work with it. 2036 will be holographic. And 2040 we will have ultra high... Not everyone is interested in metaverse. They have an ultra high resolution copy of themselves there. Which of course also should participate in some gaming. So that was some of the things we have, so crazy things that happen there. For a long range of industries, gaming is not just a personal hobby, but also an essential part of the recruitment process. The American military has spent decades playing America's Army, where up to 20 million players have been lost in tactical skills. Aircraft company's are actively recruiting players from games like Call of Duty, where extraordinary overview and spatial awareness is required, while banks and investment companies use games to assess people's risk management and market's analytical pattern recognition. And that's just today. In the future, we can expect many more dynamic layers in the recruitment process. For example, with complex virtual work scenarios designed around the individual candidate, who will solve tasks on his own and in collaboration with the avatar of his future colleagues. I'll start with you, Katrine Elmo Sjørensen. You have a PhD and a digital media expert in children's conditions. Welcome. Thank you. And with the story you just heard about my son, you can understand why you're here today. The other reason is that I was really struck by your research, which shows how both adults, whether they are parents or teachers, typically talk to their children about their gaming behaviour. Or rather, they don't talk to their children. Can you tell us a little about the research? I'm just so crazy about the term, shame. Because it says it all. Yes, and I think it's a problem that many parents can't recognize. It's difficult to understand what is so attractive about these different games. And it can also be difficult for the children to explain it to the parents. It often happens that many of the children who are gamers use a voice chat while they are talking to the other players in the games where the multiplayer is played. And that can be disturbing if you are not part of the game. So from there it becomes more and more an isolated activity and something the children do alone, maybe in their rooms with the door closed. So there are quite a few things that make you as a parent also come to pull yourself in relation to understanding it and involved in it. And then it results in, in many families, a conflict in relation to that now the game has to stop, now we have to eat. And then the child says, there is just an event that has to be finished first. Yes, exactly. And if you as a parent do not understand why it is important that finish a round or why you have to stay for 10 minutes, then these conflicts arise. And that's one of the things that's really important when you're a gamer. You can't just stop there. As a rule, you can't just stop in the middle of a mission or a fight. And you're with others. And now I have to tell you something terrible I've done, Lars. I simply turned off the power. And so both the internet and the electricity went all over the cabin. Because I simply didn't know how to get in touch. And he And he became angry. And I almost ruined his friendships. Yes, and that's another part of it. Especially boys have a lot of social stuff in gaming. For girls it's more via social media, they strengthen social relationships. But for a lot of boys it is in gaming that they get friends and strengthen friendships that they have in advance. So it's not just a game that is closed down, it's also a big part of their social life, at least for many of them. But I think what you say about the screen is interesting, because it is also one of the big problems in relation to children and young people's digital lives in general. That they feel a lot of guilt and shame about experiencing something that can be difficult. And that can be that you have come to spend a lot of money on skins and loot boxes and other virtual skills and units in a game because the game is designed in a way where you have to buy yourself in the game and you are held in that way in the game. And that is also something that as a society, adults and and parents, we need to understand and acknowledge. Because it's really great strength that you're up against as a child when you're in these games. In fact, there are some things that have not been kept. There were lots of people who were afraid that we would get blood and splinters out in the street, because there are so many who kill in these games. But in fact, the wave and the street wave just fell because people are sitting and gaming. They don't have time to go out on the street and be bored for so long. So there are a lot of myths here. Are there any more myths we can break down? Yes, but I think one of the things that has caused a problem in the analog world in relation to violence and crime is that there world, that has been integrated into the digital and into the gaming environments, where we know that there is a huge outpouring, especially of women, but also of different minority groups. And it is also a room where there are many who are being bullied and excluded, and there is a hard tone along the way. So many of these kynned expectations and kynned differences... Do you get bullied, it can be if you have to go to the gym, do you get bullied because you don't play well enough? Or do you get bullied for something you do in the other world? It can be many things. Sometimes it can also be connected to something that happens in school. If you play with someone you go to school with, then you can be bullied there. It can also be someone who suddenly gets angry at you in the game because you have played badly. Then everyone turns against you and you get kicked out of the game. There can be many different things that happen. We have also heard from several children that it just happens that suddenly there are some players who are so angry at them. Last thing I just have to ask you about before I get Sofus on the field here, or you should probably get on the field again. It's all about women. It's actually those who are being mistreated now that there have been investigations that show that it is to a large extent the girls compared to the boys who are being mistreated. So the games don't seem to be as devastating as the social media does. Or can you conclude that? Disdaining in relation to? Disdaining in relation to the investigations. In the latest school children's investigation, we could just there were many girls who were on the verge of these different levels of depression. Especially girls in 9th grade, where there are these emotional symptoms that they have expressed, like being sad, feeling nervous, stressed and lonely. And that's right. There is an overweight of girls who are being abused from those parameters. But if we look a little further, we can see that in statistics for crime and abuse, it is the men who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones One of the studies we did in Børns Vilkår shows that children who generally play games with friends they know from the physical world, feel less lonely than children who don't play games and children who play games with friends they just met in the digital world. So for many it can also be a rescue or a way out of loneliness or mistreatment. And that can also be seen in relation to the fact that the girls don't play games very much and at the same's hard to see that there aren't necessarily so many of these communities around a common third that are meant for girls. There is a story about, or we put them in some stages where it is made clear that they also talk about how they feel. So I think sometimes it's about the way we measure dissatisfaction and the way we talk about it. We're going back to gaming as a focus, because this is also very exciting. But now it's mostly boys, at least in esports, where it's only 5% girls. Welcome, Sofus Bønge. You are the special consultant at Astralis. Thank you. How much does gaming fill in relation to other entertainment forms? Well, more and more. We can see that already from the millennial generations. That's where it's tipping over, where half of it starts playing. That's also why we see esports peaking in the mainstream around 2012, 2013, 2014. It's because the millennial generation has suddenly come out on the job market and spent the last 20-25 years trying to find out where they wanted to grow from. Playing computer games. And then they come out and start making money, and being adults, and having an identity, and still wanting to play computer games, and especially wanting to play it with others. And it's out of that feeling, to share gaming and share gaming passion, that's what esports is made of. And that's what esports is in its core. So esports is the professionalized part. Are there also many who just watch and are not involved at all? Well, totally crazy. There are really, really, really many who just watch. can see from all the graphs and numbers and evidence that more and more esports content is being consumed. You mentioned that only 5% of women are doing esports, but when we look at how many are watching, it's actually 30%. So already there is another leg in it. When DR started to show esports, it was one of the things that had the highest ratings. So people sat and watched together more than what was shown on Friday and Saturday. Now we heard a little bit about the fact that gaming is good for the young. What is it that gaming does? You are a gamer yourself, so now we would like to know what is happening? Well, gaming is primarily a digital game. That means it is extremely fun, extremely motivating, extremely satisfying and then it is completely socially. And that is something that we are very aware of, that gaming is something we should do together. Gaming is something we share. E-sports is something we share. And that's also something that we're talking about a little bit. Why is it that there have been some changes in the employment? It's flipped. In other words, school attendance was 70% boys, 30% girls. Before and after corona, it has changed. Now it is 70% girls and 30% boys. It is because the boys have got a digital tool, gaming. It is to play games together. Suddenly you have a way to not have to go to school, or have a hard time, or need a break at home, or get sick and fall out of it. But you can still join the community. So suddenly it's become a grip for many young people to be part of the community, even if they don't have the energy or the overconfidence to be part of it in the physical frame. So we can see that it is used especially by boys as a relationship tool. So just before we move on to 2050, what happened during the pandemic? It all exploded there, right? Yes, what happened was that we suddenly put the speeder completely down when it was about becoming digital. And we saw that many of those who had digital communities, especially through gaming, they are big. Those who were not part of digital communities, they actually had it really, really low. And what we can see as one of the followers after this is among many of the leisure clubs and youth clubs we are out talking to, well, there is half of the young people, they have not returned to the youth club, the 7th, 8th and 9th grades. And the half that has not returned, it's the gamers. Because they can suddenly manage it at home themselves. So they do not need the framework we traditionally set up and offer them, because now they can manage it at home. So they don't need the frames we traditionally offer them. Because now they can do it themselves. So somewhere they have been digitally competent during corona and we have had a hard time offering them something that was attractive enough to share in the physical world. So they have moved a lot of their social, their stimuli, their friendships, their relationships, they have moved online. And I would say as a parent group now have sat with four children in many of these meetings, and they also have a hard time understanding when the clubs say we would like to try to make some gamer frames gamers, so they can meet physically, the parents are up in the red field and say, we don't want that, because they don't want to sit behind a screen, so they have to go out and play and climb trees. What do you think about that? There is a tendency in society, especially in Denmark, to be very good at digitalization. We have taken IT in all possible places. And suddenly we have been able to receive digital solutions within the school. Over the last 10 years, 29% more assignments have been delivered to 19% fewer teachers. We have hoped that IT could make everything smarter and make it for us. And in that we have forgotten to learn to use it. We have forgotten that there is a very big human component in how we use IT. And that is something where we can see that the older generations, millennials and earlier, who have, what can I say, blotted out this IT without thinking about it or knowing what it actually was about, they are suddenly a little bit with their hair in the mailbox and say, we should have actually put the handbrake on earlier. So therefore it has been a very long recognition of IT projects and history, and suddenly we pull the handbrake to say, we haven't actually taken a stand on this. And that's where the shame comes in, and there are some young people in that degree of shame, because some decisions are made on them by some people who don't even know what's going on. Yes, and something that is also paradoxical is learning to use and understand understand IT is also in Europe, in the last place in Europe, together with Albania. Denmark and Albania are the only countries that do not have IT education as a permanent part of the public school. Now we are starting to talk about technology understanding as a choice, that is, if it is a choice for those who think that existing in a technological world is relevant, all the others, no, it's probably not for them. They probably won't become technological at some point. They can stick to the analog papers all the time. I think I'm disappointed when you say that Denmark and Albania are the only ones... Oh my... Can I say oh my god? Yes, you can. It's actually a very fantastic, frightening report from the EU, which was published in 2021, where Holland, Denmark and Albania are the only ones who didn't have it, either either a secondary school or a public school. And the Netherlands has now developed their program and implemented it. Denmark has been in the process of understanding technology for a long time. So as we can see now, it will be a choice or for some not at all. Then we are actually together with Albania, the two only countries in Europe without IT education as part of our people's education. I know that Finland is far away. There is artificial intelligence on all citizens' plates as part of being an active citizen. Have you ever considered how it will be to play a computer game in the future with quantum computers? According to the future experts, it will be a bit of a quantum leap. A quantum computer's exponential computing power will contribute to an era of previously unseen gaming experiences and advanced simulations with a graphic level of previously unseen realism and detail and a previously unseen impossibility in the gaming universe that moves the boundaries of what we think a computer game can and is. In 2050, quantum gaming is therefore not just a hobby, but a portal to unexplored worlds and experiences that constantly challenges our understanding of reality and fantasy. Now we are going to look towards 2050, and for that I have asked Daniel Mølhøj, he is worth on Gameboys here on 24.7. You will hear what he has to say about 2050. Daniel Mølhøj, you are worth on Gameboys and you are very much into gaming and plan to do it all your life. When we're sitting at the dinner table in 2050, it's not the Sunday movie we're talking about anymore. Is it the game we've been playing? It can be. Game is an interactive medium that inspires media that in its own way is there to inspire us and give us insight into a much higher level than for example movies and TV shows, because we have a lot of things in this media, we have a decision making aspect to it. We put a part of ourselves in it. So yes, I can see that it is clearly a more open thing in 2050. It's to call it a niche thing. It's a generational thing to do and call it that. My son is going to grow up in a society now where it's where becoming a gamer and choosing gaming as a career is a very valid career path. We can already see that now, and that's why the Institute for the Development of Games has been invited to play in Denmark. Because you've seen that there's money in it, out of it. The industry and the currency in the whole industry in Denmark has grown from 370 million to 2.2 billion. There is money to be made out of it and there are also a lot of cool experiences to make out of it. So is it good or bad? In 2050 it is hard to say. But we can be hopeful that we will move in a positive direction. Sofus Bønge, you are a special consultant at Astrali. Are you convinced that gaming will be the thing that will gather us around the lunch table in 2050? Yes, I think so. But I think it will be in many different forms. I just need to understand, we collect around the lunch table? We sit and eat a lot of games? No, no, no. Today we are talking about, have you seen that movie on Netflix? Or have you heard about that news? And now we've talked about screen guilt, but that's a great question, Lars. But is it like our gamer universe, that we can sit with the whole family and talk about? Well, I think so, because as it was also mentioned here in Jens' story, there is this active component in it. We know from research from a PhD from Denmark that there is the same physical body when we play games. That means you have the same physical body as your avatar in League of Legends as a blind person with his blind stick. And that understanding, as soon as it starts to settle more, we start to accept that it is not two-dimensional, but three-dimensional when we are playing. And then, at the dinner table, it will be filled in many different ways. For some it will be a singleplayer game, they have experienced a great story, like Uncharted or Assassin's Creed. But for others it will be like when the teams play, with a fantastic Astralis match, hopefully. So it will be a combination, but like sports and games, it will be a combination of different things. What do the customers take from it? Is it from streaming, TV or...? TV. If you look at the last few years in the US, we can see that there has been a 30% drop in passive screen use. So we no longer want to see the screen in a passive way, we want to see it in a textile way. So it's a passive TV screen we're starting to make active. And Katrine, I have to ask you, do these games become more and more convincing? What do we do with addiction, loss of sense of reality? We hear here, Sophus tells us, that we simply identify with those avatars. We have already done that in the bad games. I can't even begin to think about how it will be, we heard Lars talk about in 2030. So is it really close, that it can completely suck us in? Yes, and of course there can be some positive things about it, but there are also a lot of dark sides to it. And that's also something we see in relation to AI-generated virtual friends on various social media. That it is so much on the experimental plan right now, that we really don't know what consequences it will have, especially for the children. This thing about connecting to, it can be another virtual world in a gaming universe, but they can also be virtual personalities. And hopefully we can get something out of it, and also strengthen social competences, empathy and care for others. In a way something you practice through these different games. But of course there is also a huge challenge and an assignment to put more pressure on tech companies and game providers in relation to limiting these mechanisms that hold the children and the young to a high degree. There is one thing I would like to include here. Now Gran Turismo, or what is it called, Grand Theft Auto, was mentioned at the beginning, where you train to steal cars. There is research that shows that children who have played this game, which is about making all kinds of forms of crime, they actually have a more trained understanding of what is right and wrong. That is to say, from being something that corrupted them and taught them to do stupid things, it is actually on the contrary something that is there to give them an understanding of it. So they get to practice the seance. So it's more a reality. There is also an assumption that it might be that we actually get better at knowing, okay, maybe I shouldn't just think it's okay to steal this mussel bar in Netto, because it might be that they just see me on the roof or something. So it can actually also be a way to train some of these things for net-up and the employees. So, what can I say, contrary to what these myths are, then it is actually something that is also, what can I say, training, developing. And I would like to hear from you, what does the future job of this generation expect? For example, that you go to the media and look at them, what does my day really consist of? Could you imagine that you can get some artificial intelligence to morph it into some kind of game? I can see my husband is hooked on Duolingo and trains French every day instead of kissing his wife. Because there is some kind of speed in 15 minutes, he can get extra points. Do you expect to put a layer over it? Yes, gamification is something that is used more and more. A lot of what I'm looking at is what we call game-based learning. That is, we take a stand in these places where the culture is. But it is clearly something that will come to fill more and more because it is motivating and it is a way to be in development and learn something new. One could imagine that in the future school education is less passive listening time where you just listen to a teacher and what happens instead is that almost everything is games. So you simply go to school and play games all day. And you learn a lot from it. Yes, but where is the long way? Last year we went to 20 public schools in Copenhagen and tried to help them teach children And what we experienced everywhere... I thought you were a dumb ways to die. No, but it was simply some teachers about why you can't play on the platform, what is the speed of the brakes and all that. But what we could see was that all the places where the teachers were close to a panic attack as soon as they were about to use the screens, because they knew there was technology that didn't work, they knew there were were things that would work and when you try to help one child with the screen, then there are 27 others who are sitting under the ceiling. So that facilitator role is close to non-existent, Line. And then we have an experiment with the entire teacher's teaching and. In reality, the students should take a guiding role, that is, turn the authorities a little on the head. Last month, a PhD was completed called Plug and Pay Pedagogy. This is the way we expect IT to do it that we are also standing at a place where adults are trained to fish and learn to do good education. But the more of these smart solutions we give them, the more their role will no longer be to teach the students to fish and fish together with the student. It will be that they get a fish delivered and then they have to prepare it. So they go somewhere from being a fisherman to cook. And this change in what role we have with the young, there are just a lot of places where we can see in society that there is something that, where the hen and the egg, it's like the egg has broken, or the hen hasn't met up, or something. And it's the development that could be really good and expected. And one of the most important things is simply to look at this game, this gaming, this social that is around it and say, okay, what is it that we can actually learn? And get this curiosity, which is also in the recommendation of Children's Will. Now we are at the bottom of the ranking in the world. Which country is at highest? Where can we get inspired? That's a good question. We are proud to be one of the most digital countries. But right now, there are no countries that have broken the code. There are many different mentioned, Germany is far behind in terms of IT. But the thing that worries me, that we also have to be aware of, is that in a few years there will be 45 million dollars in Saudi Arabia. We also see this kind of sports washing trend in esports. So we can see that the countries that are investing the most in it are Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Peninsula. And there are also some challenges associated with it. So we are all looking for solutions, but those who actually invest in it, are not perhaps the ones we had hoped for. Okay, well, that's very colorful, you could say. Katrine, you had a question? Yes, well, I think in relation to what we're talking about, that it becomes a reality. There has always been something, there has been an uncovered world and something fictitious that we all need to disappear into. And I think that's positive, that we can also hold on to that and develop those universes. But the difficult thing is that we move more and more into this augmented reality, where it all slides more and more together. So the boundaries are also in many ways wiped out. And I think these AI friends are a good example of that. We may have been more clear about where the difference between the fictional and the actual is.. But now it's a much bigger coalescence in terms of and in the context of that our lives as a whole become more and more digital. But what we can see from the inside, and I agree with you, but something fantastic in relation to the creativity you also invoke, is the democratization that that happens with children in future games. I think it's called Blazeball. There has been something called that. Where you can come in and you can really be part of creating your avatars. You can be part of changing the whole gameplay. You can be part of making communities. You can be part of making songs. You can be part of the game play, you can be part of the community, you can be part of the singing, you can be part of the decoration. And there comes artificial intelligence now, which gives you super powers in relation to being part of the creation. So I imagine that it will be mega creative towards 2050. Absolutely. And generations that are starting to get involved enter the job market now, it's the first generation that has had an active role in family democracy, that has been a part of this democratization of culture creation, which is one of the most responsible generations at all. Can't you just explain it, because I've never heard of family democracy. I'm very against it, I just wanted to say that. Well, there have been, through the years, different, what is it, children's views. For example, this with children's good work, and then the children were not developed individuals, and now that the children's vote is also important. Okay. So Generation Z is like the first... A competent child. Yes. And what we have, what can we say, Generation Z has grown up under is that they are competent children and they must have some degree of co-determination. But at the same time, we also see that there was an investigation here in September from Human Rights and UNICEF, where we can see that after Corona from 2021 to 2023, there has actually been a drop in the number of children in the public schools who feel that the adults always listen from 12% to 7%, so almost a halving. So we have suddenly a generation that is very responsible, who is very entrepreneurial, who wants to go out and create, but who does not feel heard and actually, what can I say, to an even higher degree than what what we previously experienced. And that is largely based on the digital. So there are some insanely exciting things in when we have this, now called democratic fire, this responsibility, this courage, how do we actually make sure that we create some frameworks that can bloom. And right now we're're doing it by saying that it's not exciting what you're doing on your iPad. I'd rather talk to you about football. It requires that you sit down with your children. Do you have any advice for the listeners out there who say, I might want to get started. Is it just to sit down and talk to them and observe? Yes, the highest of the recommended recommendations is to meet them with curiosity before the hearing. It sounds easy, but it is insanely difficult. And then it turns up in the role of the parent that suddenly it is the child who is competent into the child who is the competent and the adult who is the novice. But try to overlook it in the extent you can and be allowed to be part of it. Because it's not too late to be bad at Fortnite. You can still always be really good at it. But it gives a lot to the relationship and then you can see what kind of child you have afterwards. I could also really think about coming into the future business model, both with esports and in the gamer universe. Do you see any new trends towards 2050? Yes, there have been a lot of changes. We have gone away from the box office where you measure the number of games sold, because suddenly it is distributed for free. And then you find a way to either sell these DLCs or skins or add-ons and so on, or you sell the data. So we see that there are more and more different models and what is dangerous is that we have previously looked at it as being out of the box, like can you buy something, then it's stupid or bad. Where these, what can we say, tricks we know from general marketing, which we protect children against in Denmark, that kind of marketing can also be incorporated into the game design, but we don't have the same way to see it, understand it or encode it, because we have a poor understanding of it. A very concrete example is FIFA. When you look at how people are treated in FIFA, you look at what they write. But many who play FIFA are just as happy with what is said to them as old things and what should happen to their mother and family. But in return, the most provocative thing you can do, really something only the worst people who play FIFA. It is to force the other to watch the replay after they have scored. And when we suddenly have this, what can I say, emotional effect, it changes so much from the way we can, what can I say, now I call it as adults, understand it, relate to it, then we end up looking at a language that for them is, well, we've learned that, we just have to move on with YouTube, which is unfortunately a bad attitude. But they are happy with that. But the provocative way of acting in the physical space, it fills a lot. So suddenly I come to look at a bad place. And what are the big taboos in 2050? What are the big challenges? I'm thinking about getting into jail, which I end up being very closely connected to. It becomes something strange. As a virtual friend you are connected to? Yes, or is being beaten by one of the other players? Yes, I think that is one of the problems already today. But I also think a think about the business models that exist now. I think we will see that they are developed even more and we will use these biometric data to shape the user and influence the user to buy at certain times. Right now it is quite isolated to that it is something that happens in the mission or in the fight where you then have to buy something to get further. But when you start to be able to read, which you already can, but start to use it more, this with that you can see in the eye direction, heart rhythm, temperature, different bodily indications that you are in high or low arousal, or that you are stressed about the game, or that you are not caught by the game. I think we will see that in some way be exploited, unfortunately, in some of these business models. Now there is one generation that is strong on the index finger. That is Lars and me. When we call a ringtone, we ring the index finger. And then there are all these console players who have some wildly exaggerated developed thumb muscles. Do you think that goes going to the power of thought instead? That's a really good question. I think that things are coming back. We can see that many of the young people who are on the weapon against the last generation Z and the first Alpha have actually gone back to the two generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the creative ways to play along despite or across any form of physical challenges. One of them is the words of a doctor, that his passion for ice hockey is what he wanted to play. It has been the exclamation point in his development of fine motor skills in his body. So it can be a lot, but how we will use it in the future, I still don't know, because it depends on how well-organized the existing structures in society are. So we have a lot of people who are not qualified to join the military, their bodies are underdeveloped, because they move too little. Will there be any Pokémon GO-like improvements that will make us stand out from those chairs that Lars described? I think that all motivation comes from the four fantastic things about autonomy, mastery, meaning and belonging. So as soon as we are able to create a meaning in why you should be physically active, it can be, for example, that you can concentrate longer when you have long counter strike fights. It can also be that you meet where the child is, but then we start to go for a walk and talk about something that still fills, or then it's something we do together, then there are also these listening relationships. As soon as we start breaking the code to create these things, and that's what a lot of people do in these e-sports associations, in e-sports clubs, in our active leisure clubs and so on. So it is something active, but unfortunately we often come to sell the children something they don't necessarily see the meaning in. We have had a Spanish football player as a case in the future sport, where we can see that something from the physical sports world is starting to play together with esports, so he is disrupting the football game completely, because he says that the next generation does not want to to look at a traditional football match. There will be a lot of virtual teachers. Do you imagine that it will melt much more together with different competitors in real life? I think it does both on the competitive level, but also in our everyday life in general. I can imagine that when we go out to do other everyday things, there is always some kind of connection to a virtual world in the form of gaming or just in the form of a kind of localization together with others, where the goods in one's basket can also be understood as virtual objects that have a certain currency. So I think it will come together much more on many levels. And today we are shaking our heads with these skins and such. But what if my son gets a lot of virtual value built up? Can it be transferred to a physical loan, to an or buying a car? It's insanely exciting. Right now we are at a point where the viewers are saying that the virtual has no value. To the point that it has a value and let's just buy it. What is really exciting is to see the development we have had in the last 20 years. 20 years ago we said, why should I buy a CD on iTunes when I can buy it physically. And now 20 years later we would rather have it on iTunes than have it physically because it fills and it rips and it breaks and it is gone and that's actually a problem. So as long as it's aesthetic, we'd rather have it digitally. And in that, it's just suddenly we're putting our lives to these digital servers, which are physical servers, as you say, well, if a game provider, for example, if now Steam and Counter Strike and Valve were to compete, then Skins Snow wouldn't have any value anymore. But it's the same with Apple computers. If Apple suddenly went bankrupt, then there are no Apple computers. So we also have the term too big to fail, which will be the most integrated in our entire society. And I'm really curious about how we handle the digital, because it is, what can I say, erasing the national boundaries we have right now. We can see there is a rise in children who develop leukaemia before they turn 18, which is paradoxical when they can't bet before they are 18. But that's because they go to places that we don't know or can control. I have seen a connection between children with gaming problems and children who buy loot boxes and skins. So it's something that is formed early. We can see that there is a huge covalence, both in terms of gaming addiction, computer gaming addiction and money gaming addiction, where in almost all cases there is a covalence, either they are depressed, or they are anxious, or they are disappointed, or something. So there is this whole understanding that it is about building reliable, close, safe relationships, as some people have talked about. And then it is also about that we adults should start to value the digital in a different way than we did before so we can create structures that are more based on the digital than the digital that we could imagine. What has surprised us the most? What has been the biggest change compared to today, when we look at 2050? I think it's a bit of an abstract size, but I think the way we integrate the analog and the digital, which we already think we have done, but I think it will surprise us how easy it will be for us and how good we will be in both worlds. I think at that point it will be just one world. We are still talking about it as two separate things. Yes, they are also in high degree for parents and children. They live in two worlds today. Yes, but I think it will be one world from 2050. I think completely, as Katrine said, that what will be exciting in 2050 is when we look back, if it was possible to unite the two worlds or did blockchain and crypto start to make it completely independent of the digital and run its own track? And I hope we succeed in combining them, but it also requires that there is another conversation and a common understanding, especially among the elderly, about the value of the digital. Thank you both for being here. You may know it from the video of the boat on your screen, which is rocking and running quietly in the background. There is no heat coming from the boat, and it is totally fake. But it actually has a pleasant effect. One of the reasons is that our brains can be fooled into believing that virtual nature is real. Studies have shown this during the corona lockdowns. Here, where many were forced to stay indoors, researchers found out that the reality of nature in computer games can produce the same stress-reducing and relaxing effect as the real nature. And the better the computer graphics become in the future, the better the effect. So gaming, Lars, nice or neat, online gaming, is it something we as a society would rarely live without? I would say online gaming for fun's sake we can live without, we have done that for 300.000 years. But in general I would say we should have gaming in our education, And that is my opinion. And start the passive listening with gaming to become more clever. Slowly or fast, in relation to changing the way we create education, work and add values? I think it is going really fast and will go really fast within entertainment. I think it will unfortunately go much slower within gamification of practical things like education. Difficult or difficult to invest in this? Should you invest in esports teams or should you invest in some do we still lack a good par-plus organization or Netflix for gaming? You can also invest in skins. There are many ways to invest. From investing directly in the games to investing in startups to established companies. Rich, sustainable, exciting or clever? I would say exciting and potentially clever. It is a mega supertrend. It is. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends.

Then stop taking a very long education and get out into the labor market as young as you can. I think socially it will be a major task for education institutions to educate the population in how to use technology. Then I can't stop thinking about all those young people who are afraid of the robots coming and there will be nothing do. We get so tired. If someone gets a really good idea, it's up to the others to either copy it or smash it. And normally what you do is smash it. This is Supertrends, the show where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsøe, and every week sheoo and a failure. And when people finally succeed in starting a, then they sell it before it is scaled and globalized. It may change in the future. We will get a lot of new technologies and artificial intelligence that will make it easier to take the right path without the longterm, educational and career paths. And that can make these small and medium-sized companies good. That's what our two guests Anders Samuelsen and Ville Slet think, that you will meet in a moment. Welcome to Supertrends, which this time is about entrepreneurship. Lars Wielas, who we have on the line in a moment, has moved to Silicon Valley 21 years old after he finished at Niels Brock with a high character. He has decided to be an entrepreneur with a company he calls Alvaz AI. Do you think it's a trend we will see more of, just to start out instead of thinking about the long education we have received in Denmark? Yes, it's both something I believe in and something I also have hoped for. And I have through the years made a lot of arrangements for young people in political regime and schools, educational institutions and so on. And then typically afterwards, when you are getting for a drink or something, someone comes up and asks if I have any good advice. And I have always been completely consistent for many years, unless there is a very strong reason to do so, then stop taking a very long education and get out into the labor market as young as you can. And that's what my own children did. They finished their academic education when they were 21, both of them. And they were fully engaged in work. My one daughter, she started her business when she was 18. And while the others sat and took notes for lectures, she was writing down the invoices. Anyway, the innovation fever is close to global today, and there are more and more exponential technologies, digital technologies, gene manipulation, and everything else that is running extremely fast. Even LED light has developed exponentially. Nuclear fusion energy, which is being used to make it work, has an exponential improvement in temperature pressure, which has been achieved in several years. And when innovation is so fast, it means that what you learn in education becomes faster and faster for the parents. And I have actually... Both that, Lars, but I can't help but think about all those young people who are afraid that the robots will come and there will be nothing to do. We get hammered tired. Yes, we get more and more to do. It creates a new market all the time. But because of this accelerating technological development, the things you learn in education are getting faster and faster. I have some statistics on it, I'm looking at a graph here, and luckily, what you learn in primary school after 10 years, after this survey, 75% of what you've learned in primary school hasn't become a parent But 25% are parents. But if you take the average of all university education after 10 years, then close to half of what you have learned after 10 years, you can throw in the trash. Because it is started as something new. I don't think that going to university was learning and learning. Learning to sit down and spend time on a subject. Even the process of learning changes. We have tried to live before the internet, me at least, before Google, before Wikipedia and before AI. Everyone has tried. And then you have professional education, so vocational education, after 10 years is about 30% of what you have learned from the parents. But if you take technical education, then it is over 95% is worthless after 10 years. After 5 years is almost half of what you have learned is worthless. So what happens if you take a very long education, and I know if you want to be a heart surgeon or a pilot, I would like to welcome you to a solid education. But if you want to go out into the changing and pulverizing business life, or do some technical or commercial stuff, then the conclusion is that it's better to take a short education, and then get out into it and learn. Learn as you go. Just learn yourself what you need to know to get ahead. I I can understand that Willas is very quick to get started and learn something. I'm sure of it, but we can talk about it later. He learns a lot by having this startup project. I'm so excited to hear your timeline, Lars-Odi. How do you create a timeline for entrepreneurship and innovation? We'll find out now. Super Transmaskinen is a dynamic timeline built by world-leading experts, who, in combination with artificial intelligence, give a signal of when future groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. Many of the things we have on the timeline are things that already work on a laboratory level. So what I'm going to talk about is when it will be implemented on a larger scale in the business world. So in 2024, we will have 3D printers that are able to print on a microscopic level. And then you can say, what does that have to do with start-up companies? But it's part of it, that if you can make prototypes of the product you want to sell to demonstrate it to an investor or to test if it works and so on. If you can do it very easily with a 3D printer, it will be much faster and cheaper. And in the whole, I will just say, before I go on with this timeline, that a lot is about making startups faster and cheaper. And that process has been in my entire business life. I have started 13 companies and I can clearly see how it has become significantly cheaper to start a company than it was before. And also much faster to get to whether it works or not. And then we have in 2024, there will also be some breakthroughs in connection with what we call for example Auto GPT where you use, well a lot of people go on GPT or BART or Bing or other publicly accessible AI programs and make a prompt and get a response. But there is an example of an example where you get an AI program to play with a lot of specially trained programs so they can do something together. There is a completely psychedelic video I saw a few months ago on the internet where there is one where he would like to start a restoration business in New York and then he just asks the auto GPT to find out how he should do it. And then it starts and then it mobilizes a whole lot of programs almost in parallel. And then it starts and it mobilizes a lot of programs almost in parallel. And it then identifies where the restaurant should be and how the menu should look. It draws the menu and what there should be for some dishes and what they should cost. It makes a budget for it all and it makes a 3D rendering of how the food should look and so on. in no time. And what we actually lack is some browsers that make it much easier for a non-technical expert to mobilize many specially trained AI programs at the same time. And that's what we're really going to break through in 2024. And that will be an extra, for people who start businesses. Then we get that democratization that all interests can be allowed to come to life because it does not require an extra education in what you want to start up about. Yes, and then also in 2024, we expect that Art Intelligence will make it possible to make very fast prototyping, and that means you can, for example, show some two-dimensional pictures and then create it in 3D and print it out in 3D, and that's a combination of 3D printing and artificial intelligence. In 2025, artificial intelligence will be used to find out if you are violating some patents. It's one of the many things that can go wrong. You start a startup, you drive out of it, boom, boom, boom. And then after three years of many investments and so on, there are some who say on what your startup is doing. I have actually heard that from many people. So you can put artificial intelligence to the screen market, and then give yourself, maybe even before you start, start and say, you can't do that because there are some patents. And then the court case runs if there is such a one. Yes, it can also be. I have used artificial intelligence to make simple contracts and it takes a minute. I made one a few months ago and then I sent it to him and he said, aren't there any standard disclaimers missing? And then I just wrote, please insert standard disclaimers. I didn't understand what they were saying. Then there were seven standard disclaimers and I said, no, of course they should have been there. In 2025 it will be very common to use AI to tell you what is the problem with this contract. For example, if you have a venture capital fund that would like to invest in you, they send you a 80-page contract that is quite incomprehensible and some young people who are too tired and who haven't slept, they just write under. And then there are all sorts of clausules that are horrible. And then Constanze can say again, dude, you just have to be careful that they can end up owning your entire company if you just make one mistake. Then you will also use machine learning or artificial intelligence to find out... You just explain what you are doing and it will tell you that there are three possibilities for patents you can make way, you can simply... The whole patent process is quite complicated. But if the art intelligence department listens to what you say, and then says, that you can patent, that's attractive. And the same programs will be able to say, if you say, I would like to make a patent application for this, then it can say, you have 86% probability that it will pass. And that is... It's EU applications, and they're awful, I'll never do them again. But it's around 2025-2026, where it really has to break through. Then comes real-time translation. And there is work on making chips that translates. When chips translate, there is no time delay. And that's when you have an international team that cooperates, then it's good. And that's almost it. It is is related to artificial intelligence and 3D printing. But I will just take the last one out of many. It is 2028. There is a calculation that there will be a breakthrough for a decentralized financing platform for startups. in general, there is a democratization process going on. For example, ARK Investments in the USA, which is a huge technology fund, they have made a venture fund, where you can invest in a portfolio of venture companies and get think it's down to 150 dollars. In contrast to what most people think, the hardest part of running a company is not necessarily finding customers, but for many it's just starting the company. Based on a number of key factors such as the trust of authorities and the availability of funding and workforce, the World Bank estimates that the five easiest countries to start a business in are these in the following categories. New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Denmark and South Korea. A little further down the top 20, you can see that the World Bank considers that Georgia is easier to start a business in than Norway, that England is easier than Sweden and that Malaysia is easier than Estonia. Welcome to you, Anders Samuelsen. You are the director of UV Medico and you were previously Foreign Minister and leader of Liberal Alliance. You also have an academic background and political experience and now a role as a start-up. Why are Danes and business owners and culture, why do they rhyme so badly with each other? There are several things. And welcome. Thank you. It's great that you could be here and drive all the way from Samsø. That's absolutely correct. I think there are many things that matter. We have a high security net, combined with high marginals, combined with high taxes on tax, makes it possible to say that if you want to be an entrepreneur, you are at the same time at a high risk for a number of years of low income. When the profit comes, you will be taxed hard on the other end. This is to be kept against a relatively safe life as an employee in the public sector or as an employee in other private companies. If you get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married quickly, get married into this. And therefore, as you mentioned, Vilja is an example of someone who chooses to go the other way. But I can almost guarantee that he doesn't have children anymore, he hasn't been married anymore, he doesn't have a loan at home in Denmark. I remember I had a job at Satie's and my boss said to me, don't you buy a house soon? Why are you interested in buying a house? But I have it by the balls, he said. So it was pretty hardcore. That's what makes it so. I think it's a very common thing. There's an old saying that in the USA you hardly invest in people before they've gone down a few times, because before they don't understand what's going on. And in Denmark, the first time you try and you might go down, you're almost stunted for the rest of your life. Or if you have a failure on the way, it is something that follows you when you meet new investors, which you may try to make clear that you actually have the right idea. So these things together make it not so attractive, I think, in Denmark. So we are a culture of salary-receiving. That's what I've been working on, that you have to take an education, and the longer the better. And the longer it takes to educate yourself, the closer you get to where you get your first loan and then the flag is folded. broken. You've managed to get through with a business partner. You've started a business, which I think is also a form of business. How did you manage to get through with that business partner? I think the other side of it has to do with how you are built up. Are you very risky and afraid of sitting in a normal room? When I started the new alliance, which then became the Libra Alliance after the new alliance had fallen, I sat was one situation in the radical left where I had a really good circle and where I could just have been left alone and then I was re-elected for the rest of my life. But something in me made me want more than that and in a way I was willing to think that it should work and that we would probably get out on the other side. But it all comes with a price, which is also a difference on the way, because a contractor life is not an 8-4 job or anything else, it's also something that both mentally presses you a lot on the way, you hear about it when it's been going well and so on, but on the way there have been all kinds of challenges that have pressed you. But if you have that fundamental attitude towards not letting him, whom I work with now, my executive director, Peter Johansen, who has started many large companies in Denmark, he has clearly the same type of gene. It's very hard to imagine him as an 8-4 employee in another company. But now you have started from scratch with a new wife, children and a startup company. Is it going well this time? Well, I think so. That's what the investors say and the company's evaluation is in order. And just give three statements about what it's about. Before corona came, Peter Johansen, who is my department head, was contacted by some pig farmers who said they had a challenge with regard to South African pig pests and other things that threatened their populations. If you get that, you pay insurance. The first time, the second time, it's not much, and the third time, it's just a risk of yourself. So if he couldn't find, they had heard about UV light, ultraviolet light, which could keep viruses and bacteria down, put them in the throat and make sure you had safe areas. He dived into that, combined with the fact that he has a long history in the light industry. But 10 years ago, at Columbia University, in collaboration with a Japanese company called Ushio, they had discovered a new light source, where the light comes down to 222 nanometers. And then something happens, which I think I should say very briefly, means that the light has the same effect on viruses and bacteria, but it has a very high absorption in protein. And that's quite lucky, because that's what our oldest skin is, dead proteins, and the cornea in the eye in the same way, it changes all the time. That means that suddenly the light can not pass through what is important for us that it does not pass through. At the same time that it has a high ability to stop viruses and bacteria from helping. And in a world where we experience increasing challenges with multiresistant bacteria, this is a revolution. It can be used, it has all kinds of areas of application, so we don't get you to start with that. No, I don't want to be involved. But I want to mention two places where it has huge potential. Where we started out, beyond pharma, where we have developed some products together. But it goes very well with what Lars says, that it goes across industries, that's what's very interesting. This will definitely come to that. But in the first place, you can say that's where you have to focus, where we have learned something also from pandemics, because this will of course be a tool that will will be used when the next pandemic comes. But then there are hospitals, because of course we have a huge problem with bacteria and try to keep it down and do all sorts of things on the operating table. But as an add-on, this is of course great, because you can constantly ensure that the patient is safe. And what we then throw out and have collaborated with Danish hospitals, with Danish pharmaceutical companies, and if I may add, what makes it really interesting for investors in this company, is that we will, in addition to using this lamp technology, which you have known for about 10 years, home to what Lars was talking about before, about LED light, we have a research department, a Danish-Swedish-American research department, where we have laboratories both in the USA and in Denmark, where we have worked on moving, we have to compare it with something, in the old days we had light bulbs, until we found out that you could mix the different forms of laser light in the bottom of the glass. That's what you do with the different colors. Then you could bring white light in and suddenly the market exploded for where you could use LED. It's the same we can do now because we have had the breakthrough that we can move move it from a traditional light source and then over to LED. And then you can simply start to have the light placed in. You can put it in your mobile phone, you can put it in your aircraft, you can put it everywhere where you need it. I think we are listening here to a contractor who is very busy with his product. And that is what you should be. And it is nice to hear that you are burning for your new material. It is a funny experience. Now you asked about politics and being a businessman in politics. There is a big contrast here. Because in politics, if you put it at the top, it is a zero-sum game. Everyone competes against each other. If someone gets a really good idea, it's up to the others to either copy it or smash it. And normally that's what you do, you smash it. When you get to the real, popularized business, you can say it happens in different way. In politics, it is often called 2 plus 2 becomes minus 3. Unfortunately, even though everyone knows that it is a good idea and that one should implement it, one will experience that I come out with a product that, for example, large pharmaceutical companies can see that they need. If they can see that, we develop something together and then it becomes 2 plus 2, 8. Everyone becomes happier and you solve a problem that you could not solve a year or ten years ago. Or you buy a combination of the regulators, that is, the politicians, make bigger and bigger demands. So therefore you have to innovate all to innovate and find new solutions. It's super interesting to be in, especially when you can say that you are happy that it actually works and the investors start to look at it and say, this is what you should be involved in, because it becomes one of these experimental businesses. Now I would like to welcome Vilas, and he is in Silicon Valley. Welcome Willas Leth. You have taken direct from the answer to the gymnasium to Silicon Valley. How dare you build such a fine CV, so all companies will join you, if you want to live and have a house and a family in Denmark? As Anders could have predicted, I have neither a house, family nor a loan. You are 21, right? Exactly. That's why it was easier to move on. And in relation to a practical subject like business administration, it can't be taught at university or in an education? I don't think that hardcore business administration. I think there are a lot of tools you can learn in relation to business or product development or other technical skills that can supplement when you make manufacturing. But it is a practice that comes in and you have to learn a task in five minutes and then you have to be able to execute it and then you have to be able to do the same 20 times more on the same day. You simply can't do that in the exceptional system we have today. I have a question. Can you estimate how much of your working week you spend learning something? 100%. And how do you sleep? Do you have a plastic bag with you, or do you have rich parents? I don't have rich parents. I just have some money that makes me able to live here in Silicon Valley. But otherwise we have a mattress and bought an old car. And then we drive from Airbnb to Airbnb and meet a lot of nice people. Silicon Valley is a fantastic place to be, because people are very open. I have also had the opportunity to live with a family I now call my American family, because they just let me in and I could sleep with them. So I sleep a little bit around different places and then we have a mattress in the car, if that's okay. With the little experience I have from the private business life, then there is somewhere, I think you should pay attention to say that education is just a matter of time. I don't think that's what Lars says either, but there is less and less of what you have in your education that you use. But there is a part, I can use an example from my own business. Peter Johansen, maybe 40 years ago, was a radio technician. Is that what he uses today? No, it's not, but he has a basic technical understanding. He has a hands-on understanding through many years in different industries, but basically back to the topic of light, which makes him a really good partner for the highly educated research team we have within Photonic, the Swedish-American-Danish research team, where they sometimes need to... it's a bit down to the big theories when we're moving it over to something that is a real product. But Peter alone wouldn't be able to do that. He needs someone who has a deep, deep knowledge of the university world, in this case, and others, so these two things together give an explosive effect. And some people are so lucky, they have both parts in them. I agree with you, because from my own experience, I went to the University of Lampre for five years, which did more than I recommend others to do. And the three years were basic science, and that basic science made it easy for me to judge if something is relevant and what it actually means, etc. It's easy for me to read scientific literature, I can quickly put it into a context. So that's the basis, but that was three years. I would also say that when we meet investors, and Lars just asked how it goes with valuation, how it looks, and it has been doubled in the last two years, but it is in both cases, or it is in great part in that when we meet investors, we have a strong bond. I am not the least bit, but I have a long experience in another industry. I can connect the dots. Peter has a long CV with building big companies quickly and actually also the ability to sell them further. And then it is really, really important for our investors, they also meet these professors, which we have on the team, which makes it okay, it's not just something that happens in a workshop behind or somewhere, but we actually have a combination here that is really explosive. And that together makes the doors open very quickly and we can move from having a theory to having a product where we are the first to read, the new light source. Of course at a very high price, because the points are that it has to come down and become very, very cheap. But just the fact that you do it for the first time, it does combine with that you have the right hold, that then it goes really, really strong with the value of the company. Now we're going to look out towards 2050. It's a program about the future, so I'm going to wear my glasses. The Blue Banana is a corridor across Europe also known as the Liverpool-Milano axis and the Western European backgroud. The corridor stretches from England over southern Germany, the Benelux states and down to northern Italy and points to a geographical area where historical trade routes have accumulated industrial capital and produced some of the most innovative and transformative projects on the continent. The Blue Banana is therefore not just a place on the map, but is considered to be a creative and technological engine for all of Europe, where a pulsating network of entrepreneurs leads the regional early stage into a global future. Vilas, it's you who is in the labour market in 2050. How do you think you have continued to develop your work and learning? Would you think back and say, I was only honest and ended up with Vil and the Worm and Woman number 1, 2 or 3. Or can you keep that learning up all your life, because you are no longer dependent on an educational system? Can you try to put on your future glasses and give some pictures of them? What is the future work life you imagine? Yes, of course. I think I have built a form of ability to assign the knowledge I need at a given time. And I think that is my strength in relation to 20-50 years and to learn in that way. How will you do it? Because you often have blind spots. Anders has a whole band of different people. There are professors, some who are used to starting up and some who are used to communicating. How do you ensure that you get what you don't know you don't know you can't afford? The easiest way for someone like me to do that, when you are so young, is to talk to people with a lot of experience. Is that why you are in Silicon Valley and not doing it here in Copenhagen? Among other things, I think Silicon Valley has the advantage of just saying that there is a mentality out a mentality that does not exist in Denmark. We met a guy called Adam Draper who has a venture capital fund whose goal is to build an Iron Man suit. He wants to fly around and be Tony Stark. And I think that mentality is what has really made us look over here. The other thing about 2050 is, as Supertrends has also talked about, that from idea to prototype and product, the time cycle is reduced exponentially. I am a good example of building a prototype for the product we have today in 14 days by using ChatGPT without any experience in programming. And it only decreases, now we are talking about almost months, where the process becomes faster. And I think that's what continues towards 2050, that it becomes faster and faster and faster to get an idea and then make it into a prototype and see if it is something we can actually use and make into a business. I have a friend who has taken a six-hour online course in artificial intelligence at MIT and he told me that he has a son who is a student at a university in the USA. He is 18 years old and he has founded one of many AI groups at this university. It has grown very big very fast. But since he was 12 and a half years old, he had been programming just for fun, to make a computer game. So he sat down, that father and tried to prompt AI to make code-free software. Where it simply writes the code from some manual instructions on what to do. And they made, I can't remember, I think 12 prompts, and it took two to three hours, and then they made a copy of this game, which had taken many years, in very few hours. So it's an example of how fast it can be done. Something, Anne, I'm thinking about, Vilas, now you're thinking about the educational institutions we have, which are not particularly competitive. I know that there are people from the educational world who are listening in here. What would your advice be if they should be attractive to someone like you? I am sitting in the management of CBH Business Academy and who are experiencing a dropout from someone like you who says, I just do it myself. What should be more practical? Can you give some words on how this education should look like in 2050? I think the easiest answer is to say that it should be more practical. I think it does a lot, but there is another important part in relation to learning in workshop. It is also to be inspired and to build a network around yourself, which is good at helping you get started. And this has been a good advantage for educational institutions. I have a friend who is currently on a two-month course in Stanford. And at Stanford, because of the brand they have, they can attract some of the world's best speakers. And they have, for example, got the co-founder of LinkedIn to come in and have a chat with them and take a trip in the mountains. And then some forms of activities where you can of course get some practice, that is, come out and be in some practice in a company or try yourself to start projects or offer small amounts to buy in so you can get the students to start their own businesses. Combined with an aspect of networking, both by experienced people and people, I can say, to build the framework for the students who are going there. I think that's clear, that's something that you need. Anders, what do you think when you look at 2050, if you have the big arm movements? We can see here that there is a small revolution with democratization, with young people who look at where things can create value for me and walk new paths. So how much turbulence and of turbulence and changes in the business industry. You have a little boy at home, right? Yes, that's right. I can't imagine what he will deal with. So much is going to happen, and fortunately most of it is good. I'm very inspired by Lars' book, The Creative Community. Of course you are! Of course I am! Which I've read many years ago, and after that I got there as the first one, I think on Facebook. You don't really understand what it was about, but I got there when I logged in. It also shows that there should be someone to push in the other end. And then push out again. And then you can grab those opportunities too. But no, you can't. There are also people who 20 years ago would have given up and said they can't be used for anything because of a handicap or something else, they will have to stay and celebrate in a farm or something else. And then because of new technologies, suddenly the skills they have, will they suddenly be put into play. Their skills to maybe be able to focus and see through large amounts of numbers and all kinds of other things, combined with what technology can do afterwards, brings suddenly some skills into play that you could not see at all 30 years ago. So there will be a sea of new jobs, while we will be incredibly rich constantly. A student today is incredibly much better off than a rich farmer from 400-500 years ago. He can travel the world without any problems, he doesn't die of some insane disease like 35 years old, because you can quickly be treated for that today. What's his name? He has a cell phone. Landowner, he wasn't close to that. There is so much, where you say, what is wealth? And if you compare it to that field, we will just become incredibly rich. The possibilities will be greater, there are also more fall groups of course, but I think that things, I am very optimistic that things will solve themselves, because when the pressure is high enough that there will be a new solution, then a new solution will come. Through practical experience combined with someone who has some basic fundamental theoretical understanding understanding and then these new technologies that can be connected. I can't help but ask the elderly now that we are here and we have a young Silicon Valley. We can see that there has been almost a tenfold increase in people starting their own business over 60 years old. And I think that also indicates that the existing labour market can't fit other profiles that might want other things. But it's also quite fantastic, because it's people with a large network, a lot of experience. Is that something we see, that you run careers and new careers and get some entrepreneurs who start at a relatively high age? Now I have just turned 56 and this is the first time I am doing entrepreneurship in a private sector. So you are using your time smarter now? Now we hear that Villas is working 24 hours a day. I use my time in a different way and my skills in a different way. I use it to open doors for a new startup in a completely different way than others. I have an experience that makes me, even though I haven't been in business, see some challenges before others can. I can see that we have moved a lot, but none of us could have done it alone. It's the combination that makes it. To go back to what question of the elders, you can use Peter Johansen as an example. He had a long experience with light, laser light. He got the idea of doing something called frequency doubling, which means halving in wavelengths. When you can make 450 nanometers or 445 nanometers in advance, super super easy, then he goes to these professors, apropos, and Google who is the best in the world at photonics, and then finds out that one is called Nicolas Vollet, tries to find out where the hell he can get hold of him, and then it turns out he has just moved to Aarhus. In what case is that right? Calls him and says I have this idea, I don't think it can be done. And the theorist says, in the first instance, that it is hopefully impossible. He then calls Peter three days later and says, you have got your point. And this, theoretically, may never have happened. But Peter's practical experience, age, or whatever you want to call it, combined with this, and then that and finding an old, or taking the basic book, people don't read much, but on page 355, far inside the book, there is something called the Cherenkov method. Combining that into the game, and suddenly we have a theory that we can go out and get the first investors on board and say, we believe in this, we can do this. My point is then just in relation to what we just talked about. It is a combination of having a sense of reality, something hands on, combined with theory, combined with using new technologies. I think it's a super interesting time to live in and I wish I was 20 years younger. It could be that you will. We have another program that deals with how to hack your age as you get younger. You can start by training a little and eating more. That's it. Lars, we have two guests who we would like to hear their perspective on 2050. So we would like to ask you a question. I have a question for both of you. The question needs to be explained in context. If we look at the big super trends we are experiencing now and expect in the future. One of them is that the borders are being wiped out. That means that more and more people are not going on retirement. They are working until they die. People don't work in any special places, they are just digital nomads. Education is something you take all your life, so there are flowing boundaries. And at the same time there is another phenomenon, which I have been calling the civilisation process of technology since yesterday afternoon. Humanity has gone through a civilisation process. We have become less and less violent. Is it a question? Yes, it becomes a question. But when a new radical technology comes, whether it is a steam engine or whatever, then in the beginning our use is quite brutal and there are all kinds of side effects. Also, for example, the fact that we don't have to work physically, which makes us, many of us, we become cool and sleepy, right? And then you find out, oh my god, you should probably go to a fitness center or something. So now, if we say up to 2050, it will be much easier to make startups and it will be more and more flexible together. And people will have shorter education and education themselves all the time. And then of course there are some who do not get anything at all. And one of us wants to, and Vilas or Anders wants to tell us how our adaptation to the opportunities and the accelerating change we will experience is going to be. When will we be good at dealing with this? Vilas, we start with you. You're sitting right over there. I'm sitting here where it's all being created. In relation to adaptation, and can you just repeat the word again? Civilization? Process for technologies, that is, how people learn to have a sensible relationship to the new possibilities that technology has created. And what I'm talking about is that you can start up on no time and everything will be smooth. Yes, I think that there will be a huge, between those who are able to use these new technologies to start new startups and those who are simply not able to. I think that socially it will be a major task for education institutions, both from the children's school to the PhD and universities, to educate the population in how to use the technologies. So, just like we had a agricultural society, then some started industrialization, and some became unemployed in the transition period. They found work in the city. Thank you, Vilas, and I'll just say thank you for being here. I don't know if I'm answering the question now, but I see a part of the answer. You're asking how we adapt to these new technologies. We do that by getting fat, because we don't have to do as much, and then we can go to the gym. Or, Novo Nordisk invented a product that makes life easier, you don't have to get as emotional as much to achieve, not to get overweight. My point is that there are some trends, I don't know if it's also called super trends, that are threatening us as humans, and that is still disease, i.e. premature death, and it can be in different ways. Some of it can be that we use a lot of antibiotics and then we get multiresistant bacteria, where we can get on the track, because you always need to find a solution. It becomes a greater challenge and a greater requirement the richer you become. I think in your book, the richer we become, the bigger the demand we make for the environment. It has to be a cleaner environment, we have to deal with it. We have advice for that, because we have become richer. And the longer we live, the longer we want to live. And we want to avoid unnecessary risks, and therefore there is always a pressure on new technological solutions. For example, when we now experience that we can use antibiotics, then we experience resistance, then we must have found a solution to that. And then there will be someone who can see that here is something where we can combine it, as do now, by using light in a new way. Earlier, innovation was possible to do, maybe 100 years ago. Today it is possible to do. And then there are some side-tracks that come up, if I may use your things about it. Because, Anders, when I talked to you, it was not only about health. And I would like to have you tell you about it. I think it's a good picture, and that's why I wanted to talk about it. That it can be used to disinfect, but it can also have all kinds of other forms of use in other industries. And I think that's a little crazy, because I know that the other industries are not necessarily. And I could also ask Lars here, right now, towards 2050, will we get such a industry slide that we have never seen before, because the solution comes from all kinds of strange places? This is where it can of course be like, okay, is it a universal means of everything? And it's not. But you're right, it shows that when you can, like Lars pointed out, explosive development is different from LID, when you first knew that, then of the LED, it was a huge market that opened up. You can't even imagine it when you start out. We experience the same when you come down and make LED lasers in the invisible field. In theory, you can use it for easier distance assessment, so you can make much safer driving without cars. Because the signal you send out and get back, it should not be filtered, because it is disturbed by visible light. If you are in the invisible, it is a much cleaner signal you get back. You can use it for all molecules and so on, have their own DNA, i.e. a kind of barcode. When you affect it with light, this field will send a little vibration, send a signal, called rhamastopoeia, where you send a signal, get a signal back, and then you can say, is it hash, or is it narco, or is it something you want out of water. When you get down again in the invisible field, you get much cleaner signal. There is a huge potential market for communication, that you can make unhackable communication via the air. Super super interesting market too. And something we didn't think about in advance, but because we also installed lights on some restaurants in Thailand, they call from down there and say, do this in favor of myg, because our customers will not be stung by myg anymore. We don't care about that, it's not something we were aware of, but we do'm so excited about that, Anders. We do that because we connect with the University of Copenhagen, because we want to be focused on the right way, do research on it. They do it in collaboration with a large malaria center in Africa, come back and say that it works, it looks like it is more effective than the wildest pesticides. Okay, you start with something where you want to try to help the wheat farmers, and suddenly you are now with something because you have combined people with long education, people with practical experience and something with opening doors to that we now, in collaboration with a very large Danish foundation, now for Elver, is starting a project to find out exactly what is happening here. And is it really true that we can do this, as late as yesterday, where there were articles about that some of these mosquito-borne diseases, they are beginning to spread to southern Europe due to global warming and so on. So it's not just on Finnish terraces and terraces in Florida where you are tired of mosquitoes, but you really have a means that also has a potential. Therefore, we may have a company that stands for, and more and more speaks for it, a very broad... Yes, and where we have to remember as entrepreneurs to focus on. That's why I started by saying healthcare, home care, and so on. Where it's completely laid out, where we can start. And then you have to find out, should you license it, how to use it, so it actually becomes a, and I believe it will be, of course, a billion-dollar company. We are already on the way to being what the investors and what we believe in. But it will be, if we can handle this correctly and solve patent challenges. Thank you very much for... Malaria. Malaria itself. Anders, I think it has been super exciting and we could talk about all the applications. I think you should go back to that with a couple of years of space to fill up. I think it was a very good case on the meewerksætteri, that there are all kinds of ways to do it, and you shouldn't get stuck either. You have to be open and take the opportunities that are offered. I wish you all the best and good luck, and thank you very much for being here. In hopes of attracting talented meWerksættere, Helsinki is offering the world city in the world the concept of City as a Service. In its simplicity, it is a 90-day all-inclusive city park, where you relocate to the capital of Finland as easily as possible to experience how it is to live and work there. The service is called the 90 Day FIN Programme and it helps you find a home, introduce you to the city's professional network and engage in two weekly cultural activities, from visiting museums to winter bathing. And if you have your family with you, you also get help finding places for institutions for your children. Finally, when you have hopefully seen the city's attractive features, you find included in the package all the necessary help for the paperwork that needs to be done with regard to to a possible permanent permit. So Lars, very briefly, and you should just answer yes or no, do we get more business flow, as we have heard with Anders and his company, or is it a one-off because he has made a game-changer technology and most of them are going deep and special? It is very clear, and I can see that from the prognosis, and I think his company is a fantastic example of it, that you are constantly surprised by something that happens in another field that can affect your own business. And it is a huge opportunity, but of course it is also a challenge, because it is a problem if you overlook it and the competition sees it. Is investment nice to have or need to have? Can we in Denmark say, well, it's nice that the others are competing, we've heard that it's expensive, it's dangerous. Should we have it? It's totally need to have. The big companies like Novo have innovation in their houses, but you also need a lot of the small companies, then you get something completely new. Will this be about being a contractor or intrapreneur in companies? Is it something that will accelerate towards 2050? Is it going slowly or fast? I think internationally, the fact that work is independent, whether it is growth or lifestyle in the company, will grow. So it's a so it's a super trend. I think it will explode, because we get so many methods to do it. Is it something you can invest in, apart from Anders? You can invest in individual start-up companies, but there are also funds, venture capital funds, and there are more and more types of funds that you can invest in. Rich, sustainable, smart or big? What do you mean by big? Big business, growth? All four, it's all about the bottom. So it's a champagne float? That's right. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrance.

I'm completely drained. It has become a practical problem, which is actually a big problem, which no one really has solved. There was a well-known experiment with IBM, where they told people, from now on you can decide for yourself how many holidays you want to have and when. Two out of ten employees feel that they have a good friend at work. If you add that to six out of of 10 employees who feel they have someone to trust, the bottom line increases by 12%. It's a bit of a shock that this is the first interactive holographic meeting room in a flex office. This is dangerous. There are more people dying from loneliness than from smoking. This is Supertrends, where we investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsøe. Every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrends, Lars Tvede. Welcome to the future. Our working life as we know it is in total chaos. The big companies are tearing their hair out, they have cut down the square meters by 30% and are fighting a hard fight for people to get a free will to come in and greet their colleagues. Because what characterizes our home is that we say, take your own cup of coffee, shoulders fall down, pull the weather all the way into your stomach. In this episode, we will look at the workplace of the future and the human activities that should strengthen towards 2050. Lars, when I have been here all day, eating in the canteen, I can have been in a flow and had a great time with you, but I want to be in the first row the next day. I'm completely drained. I can't stop thinking about whether these workplaces could be turned upside down, so that it was like getting a battery supply, so that you were actually left behind. I don't know what to do. Yes, I have some prognoses I'm going to read up on a little. But one thing is that there is a perception that at some point, offices will become more and more social meeting places, so people will work more from home, so you will come more into social interaction. So there is a lot of movement going on to make offices better, so I am very excited to hear what is being told in this. What is completely on the mind is that it was the workplace that dictated what was to happen. So you went in on autopilot, sat down in front of the computer you had just been assigned, and then you had to figure out how to make things work. So it was the office that was in charge of what kind of activity it was, what kind of value I was are thousands of things that affect me. I also have some customers and colleagues. It is like a Tetris game that needs to be played. It's in a high degree bottom-up, because it's about the individual's own leadership to create value. But then you have to make it fit with the others. That's the point, as you also say, Lars. It's the common thing that happens. I can go very far when I'm alone at home, and things always get complicated when I meet you, but it gets better. It gets better. I hope so, during the day. You're still waiting. SuperTrendsMasch machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives a signal of when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. That's what it is. In 2026, there is a prediction that more than 10% of interior designers for office environments, they want to use gamification and crowdsourcing. I was quite surprised when I read that, but then I thought that was a really good idea. So I'm used to using crowdsourcing as 99designs to get a logo designed and that sort of thing. But you can also, since the locations are rendered digitally today, you can actually put a office landscape out and say, we are making a design competition, who can do this in the coolest way? Then it can be someone who is in Bangladesh who wins the competition and gets some money for it. So it could be an integration between different methods and technologies. Then in 2027 there is what is have digital coding, where the whole wall will be digital screens. It will be so extensive that you will see it many places, and then you will, for example with AI, be able to completely restyle an office. So in the same year, in 2027, it will start to become will be normal to make ultra thin LED screens that can be bent, that is, you can put it on curved surfaces. And that will also mean that you will get some wildly sexy designs around in our office landscapes and at workplaces. So can you you, as I said at the beginning, that when I feel at home, my shoulders fall down, can you make a fake home around you, so you actually think you're sitting in your bed, and then you're actually sitting at a desk, but it looks a little different? Yes, You can restyle in all sorts of ways. You can also take a wall. Let's say you work in a basement, then you can say, I would like to have a window. And the view should be to Hyde Park or to a jungle in Brazil. And then you get that. So it creates a wild flexibility. Cheaper than square meters. So in 2028, half of all interior designers use advanced soundscaping, and it's a very advanced technology to control where there is sound, where there is no sound and where there is anti-sound and so on. And then 2028, it is the year of the south, the first interactive holographic meeting room in a flex office. Flex offices is of course also a very big trend in itself. I would like to say that I have, as a future researcher, been looking forward to the fact that you now get peace. But among other things, when I work with Dennis, he has some earplugs that give him total peace. I feel so lonely with him because he can't hear when I small talk to him and say something like that. I'm so happy for the headphones. thank you. Then I'll let you go, then you have to nuss him a little instead. So in 2030, there is a expectation that coworking space will account for 30% of all office areas in the world. And it's clearly a trend that's on its way. How fast it will happen, there are many suggestions, but that is what we have. So in 2030, there is also one about that outside of big cities, half of all office staff work on average outside of their central office, that is, from home or where they are they are. 2030 will also be a smart office chair, which will make you aware if you are sitting badly, it will constantly shake if it was me sitting on it. Then there are collaborative walls, so you are sitting in an office and then you have a wall, and on that wall it looks as the office continues with those who are in Tokyo. So you can constantly see each other. And then there are two statistics I would like to highlight. In 2050, there is actually no statistics, it simply says in our prognosis, traditional offices largely obsolete. When do you say that? 2050. So it's a pity, but I have invested in a office building that should be built in the next 100 years. Yes, I listened to Goldman Sachs update a few days ago about commercial real estate and they have huge problems with office buildings. They said that they thought that all office locations in the USA on average, they were, they were to be reduced by 40 to 45 percent in value. So I will come to the last one, it is in the year 2100, there is also a prognosis that says that remote work, that is, home work or working away from an, will be the primary way to work in the whole world. There are many ways that the workplace of the future can be developed. But the American startup Prophetic really thinks they have broken the code. They are working on a digital device that will make everyone able to take night watch from their dreams while they sleep. The device is a headband that uses ultrasonic to activate a state of lucid dreaming where you are awake in your dreams and in this way use your dream time productively and make the brain a workplace. Then the director could get the layout for the board meeting, the developer could get the code and the racers could practice the track one extra time. All of this before the day even started. Then I would like to welcome you Frederikke Aagaard from Together Architecture, which you have founded together with Anne Marie. We have worked together in all kinds of contexts. I turn back to you in a moment. And then there is you, Claus Friggaard Christensen from Ernst & Young. You are a Workplace Experience Officer Designer and have just completed a large survey of what it is that companies have as challenges with this work life in the industry. So I would like to hear from you. What surprised you the most? And welcome! Thank you very much. There are a lot of surprises. One of them is that you talk a lot about salary as one of the most important things for employees in relation to where they choose to be. It's actually a global study we've done that shows that. But it's not like that in the Nordic countries. It's actually flexibility that's the most important thing for employees, and salary is a two-factor factor. Is it something like, we're all in the Maslov's-Behårs pyramid, or we pay so much tax, it can be just as much or where are we here? Because it must be self-actualization, it's all the way at the top and the salary is a little further down the triangle. Unfortunately, I can't really answer the underlying factors, but you can see that it is like that. And then you can consider as a company, what is it that you would prioritize, how you would attract talent. And if you don't give them that flexibility, what happens then? So that's one surprise. Are there other things? Yes, there is. I'm actually surprised that it looks like some large organizations actually want to go back to the time before corona and that you have to work at the office all the time. You mention Elon Musk. Tesla might be able to get rid of it because they have an incredibly strong brand, but I don't think all companies can get rid of it. And some of the companies that are actually out there doing that, if you look at the research we have done, are in some industries where the employees most likely will have the flexibility. But Claus, can you ask people what they want? Because then we will just have cookies and snacks every day. But sometimes we need feedback and other people. We just didn't know before we got in. So are we smart enough to ask, and are the leaders and employees agree that they should have this flexibility? There has been a gap between employees and organizations as long as we have investigated since 2020, actually. Where employees would like more flexibility than employers are willing to give. So it's a gap that simply just lies there. But I believe a lot in the physical workplace. I believe a lot in the physical meeting. And we, the EU, would really like to have the employees in, but we don't want them to sit there all the time. And we don't want anyone to never come in. So I think that's what you need to find as an organization, that balance. Frederikke, you have in your name on the company Together Architecture put two big lines under that we would like to be together, it is important if we are creating value that goes beyond what we could work on. We have a completely different program about these digital nomads who work as freelancers for many different companies. And I can understand that it is a super cool career too. And it can be right for some people at some point in their lives. But besides that, we want to have feedback. We want to get out of our own bubble, which is already massive. So it's an important part of going to work. So if you can't attract people with money? What do you need? You can't convince people to be in a relationship with you. You just have to be attractive. And it's the same for companies if they have to attract the talent that Claus talked about. Even before the lockdown, there were several health organizations in the world talking about, hey, we have an loneliness epidemic, this is dangerous, there are more people dying from loneliness than from smoking. It's really unfortunate for society. People become depressed, stressed, inactive, unproductive. And that's expensive for society. So we need to be together and we need to have something in common. I think we will also see a shift in housing, in the way we live, in the way we organize families, be a family in the future. And it also applies to the workplaces. We need to create some kind of fellowship. I love and embrace all the technology there is, but 90% of our communication is non-verbal. It is our micro-expressions in the face, it is our body language, it is our facts, it is our tone-synch, it is our voice-over. And we can't just take that to ahour meeting. That's one part. And then also, you want to keep your talented employees. And if they never get into the office and become part of the corporate culture, part of the Friday bar or Wednesday party or whatever, then it becomes a poor workplace where no knowledge is shared. Two out of ten employees in the USA feel that they have a good friend at work. If you increase it to six out of ten employees who feel that they have someone to trust, then the bottom line rises by 12%. Crazy. So it's not just about quality of life and commitment, it's also about creating a good result. But there is more to it than those coffee machines, Claus. What should you do? Lars talked about different technologies, about the physical expression and how you work in the workplace. But I think there is some data we can use for something that we actually have the opportunity to. And then some technologies that do not exist today. There have been some challenges that we did not have before Corona. A completely banal question, should I come to the office today or tomorrow? How do you meet physically? How do I get it booked? So it has become a practical problem, which is actually a big problem that no one really has solved. And I believe we can solve it with data and new technology. I have a question in that connection, because one of the things I believe in is one of the biggest trends for the next two or three years. It is personal AI, where you have access to a digital assistant via your phone, who not only organizes your everyday life, but also coaches and all that. But you could imagine that if a lot of people go around with their personal AI, then these personal AI's can just talk together and suggest when and who should meet. Exactly. And it's already in progress, even with the big applications at Microsoft. You are being suggested some things and then you can say yes or no to it. So we talk a lot about the flow of work. It should not be too complicated to book a meeting place or meet with someone. Some technology based on data should suggest something that gives meaning to you and then become better at suggesting it over time. And that's me. Frederikke, we get worse at body language. We may also become worse at talking to people who don't look like us. So you talk about it's cool to have six good friends at work, because then I become so productive. How do you nudge or create frames so that people meet across? Can you do these things? And how much does aesthetics and these things around us mean for our well-being? Well, I see all technology as a tool to make us better as people. So our needs are at the center. And you can say that many office landscapes have just recently been replaced with 90% tipped fleece, compact laminate and screen. And it really stimulates our nervous system badly. And that's why you relax when you're at home. It's not that bad when you say you have a whole day on the redaction, that you get a little tired of it. Because at home you have a bigger variation of materials, there are different surfaces, there is wood, there is linoleum, there is wool, stone, metal, there is a variation. And we know that this stimulates our nervous system to become more curious. We ask more questions and then we are a better employee. So in our enthusiasm for OLED walls and such, we also have to think about something fabricated that works stimulating. Let's get out into the future. According to the International Labour Organization, there are about 2.3 million death cases per year worldwide. More and more companies therefore are already resorting to artificial intelligence to optimize the working environment in real time. And in the future, this kind of pattern recognition is a necessary standard. Here, managers are automatically alerted to dangerous situations before they appear, so they can react instantly to unstable stilasers or reels, things you can stumble over or unsafe electrical installations. In office environments, AI monitors the ergonomics of employees and heavy lifting and repetitive movements are always done by robots or by exoskeletons. But it will't be about physical safety alone, because mental health is just as important, so sensors and smart wearables catch signs of stress and distress before it develops into serious problems. If we look at 2050, it will all be about value at the end. We are working to create value for companies, customers, each other, the society. The best way to do that is to go from being seen as a resource, as we were talking about last time, that it is the network that should work, the team that should work. If it works well, we will become much more productive, to grow as people. We should become better and better at delivering value. So it's a form of feedback fitness. We get trained, we get better. So if we look at the 2050, Claus, what functions should these jobs have? I think there will be some of the functions that it has today, but also more functions. We talked about being lonely and this privacy. On the one hand, I think you should try to divide things. If you want to be at home, you should be at home. You can't be at home in the office. If you want to do sports, then do sports or sit with a third wheel and work. But that's more of a personal opinion. You're talking about a meeting house. Yes, but at the same time, I think you should offer some opportunities and more opportunities than we have today. And we looking at creating a place with Sustainability Hub, where you can maybe as a team take it, so you are not at the office. If you have a project, or you have to make a offer or solve a task for a customer, then your team takes five people every day for a full day. You're not at the office, you're in a slightly different place. And that place might also have a café next door, where you can go and have some beer or have a good time or do whatever you want. And then it becomes much more social, and then there are some who might want to stay longer than others. Some might become friends. Some might get married. I don't know. But it's all good. And those who want to go home, they go home. But then there is a new possibility that is within the company, but also in the range of what the company is. And I think we want to see much more of that. And that's where you have to mix in how much we should go into, for example, people's sports habits, in their eating situation. We have had a lot of health programs that are about shortening our DNA or having special diets. And you're sitting there and you have to shorten our DNA and have special diets and you are sitting there and have this human growth on the line at the same time as we have to be social individualists we also have to function in a community how do you get all these ends to meet in this future? I think there will be a lot more nudging based on data and recent research. I believe that you should offer colleagues different opportunities for healthy food, for motion, for everything. Of course, to avoid that they work too much and get too stressed. But I don't think so much, and we as an organization, that you have to be prescriptive and say you have to come in to the office not to be sick, you have to eat this and you must not eat this. But more to give people information, because we have some of the best educated and smart people who are based on data. How do you get them to have good habits and good behavior? Well, that's education and information. Frederikke, we are also talking about what you have to do. it is not only to get human growth, we also need to have planetary growth, we also need to think about sustainability, we need to think about moving away from something that is used, you mentioned that what you had thought about in the form of furniture and so on, it was not even something we were passionate about. It was just something that was... How can you think much more holistic? Because there are these snowflake generations who have huge expectations, but at the same time there are also some of those who will be very sad if they experience that there are big sandwiches being served every day, because they know very well that our climate can't handle that. How do you frame where the focus should be of the company in the future in relation to that it should be what it's worth and how much it should cater to the individual? It should express its own values. So that there is a consensus with the vision form and what you enter into physically. But the big change we see is that there are no more domiciles being built. Headquarters are simply out. We see multi-user houses and that can also be when you say Klaus, you can meet somewhere else. It can be that a company that has a house in Copenhagen, makes satellites around Jutland. So when you are in Sommerhus in Northern Jutland, that you can meet and take some meetings in Aalborg or wherever. that you can meet more often and it becomes more flexible. That there are also some synergies in working with other companies, so that you can maybe share these satellites with. That there can be a good effect in working together in that way. So this thing about someone having to build a big, nice head office, which really has to show power and impress customers, that's something we see less and less. But something else is that we have a society where we expect that by 2050 two thirds of the jobs will be changed. The old jobs worked fine in an industrial society logic where you had to deliver on one project and you had to go deep and be good at it. But suddenly we have to navigate in a completely different and much more out of the box way. Some people like that, but there are also many who get extremely tired of this. So how can we make it more safe, more fun? My advice would be, when I think about the workplace of the future, it is a physical place, but it is also much more. We call it the dynamic space. It is areas where you can move walls, move furniture. If the furniture does not fit your purpose, you can change them. Because if we set up offices in expensive areas, high-end locations, and then just move in with some furniture, and then leave it all standing, then we have to adapt all the time. And it might be a great investment to move around things and have people who can help with that you so people don't have to work in the same way. But the dynamic space, not only with furniture, but also technology, so you can move around. That's for sure the future. And that can cater to your work situation, but also your personal preferences and the fun and the plant and all that. So there are all the unsaid things. Bridgewater, for example, they have tried to put an AI layer over it. So if I talk to Frederikke, I will later say, has she given me more energy or if she has drained me. Have I contributed to her? Have I lifted her or drained her? And why? And every day you go home with full transparency. It is Vae Dahlia's big dream that you go home and there are many employees who can't keep up with the work. They change jobs very quickly because they think it's very hard to get character every day. But those who are happy with it, they have the joy that when you have to make a project, you don't just get to rip, rip and rip as usual. But then it says I can actually see you lack this dynamic and this dynamic and this dynamic. Lars was also a bit on it with that we get these personal avatars. Could that be something that helps us create these new arrivals? Because we end up going out into other collaboration relationships. What is that unique selling point that makes us still have physical places to meet and be at? The assembly houses, as you call them. What is different now, and what you talk about Claus, that you call dynamic jobs, or flexible jobs, there are no one who is setting up a status now, who say, now we are just buying 20 tables and then we have to have this and that. We think of a workplace much more flexible and it's also to get into how to meet and be together. We solve many things. We know each other, then there are the desk tables, the meeting rooms, the canteen, the classic workstation. We don't have that anymore. Or I hope there aren't that many who have that anymore. We have removed the canteen.'s a dead square meter. It's expensive to have so many square meters. How does that work? It works quite well. We have made a kitchen. A more homey kitchen. You have to put the washing machine in yourself, because we don't want to have those dirty, dirty toilets with dirty talarqas. But it becomes a natural meeting place where you can get involved, whether it is to be measured in AI. So there are people working there and then there are people sitting with lard on their table in the keyboard? If you want to. There are not so many who choose, but then it is also a space to celebrate your birthday for your closest employees. So there's life all day. Yes, exactly. And that's what you get into. It's part of the reception. It's what you step into. It's a heart for the company and the way of getting there. So in relation to measuring what kind of day you have had and how you have been stimulated, the technical way of measuring it, I don't know, but I know everything about how to stimulate in different ways. And one of the things we know is, for example, if you are going to have an intimate conversation or create trust and be close to people, then we should reduce the lighting. This is something we see in many existing office buildings. The problem is that there is a light source where you have the same lighting over the whole thing in 4000-5000 Kelvin, that is, it is quite cold, blue light. 500 lux is quite strong light, because that's what you need for a working class. So it's like listening to a melody with one tone. If there's no variation in the lighting, then there's no variation in the way we're together. So it is one of the tools you can use to develop specific ways of interacting and meeting and creating boundaries for sharing knowledge. And do you want that? Because it sounds a bit like law enforcement and there should be good and clean and the light should be and such. Is there room for that also in large companies? I think there is absolutely. It's about creating some experiences in the workplace that are individual, adapted to the individual, but based on a platform that is effective and economical to pay for. So for example light, you can imagine that light in a place can connect to the individual in some way. Who knows? And yes, there is already an individual programmed light. So when I go and sit at this table, the lamp can feel that it is me and adjusts itself according to my intended lighting. And the fun thing is then, in that case maybe, that it can be a cheaper solution. Because when there is no tourists, you just have to go. I can't help but think about the taboos around. I was out somewhere, I won't mention any places, but there were some people they call stuck-up. They walk in like Germans on tourist destinations and put on their gloves because they just have that space every day. And instead of laughing and pointing fingers at it, you can't say, but there are some of us who just want to have that predictable seating space, and that's what we're making up. And then there are those who are not so many, because we can see that there are many who would like to be flexible, but those who are, they have to be bothered by it. They have to have that evil grumble and that way of being. And then there are others who are really good at packing together and moving. So can we allow ourselves in the future against 2050 to treat people differently? Yes, we will. Both companies have different types of employment contracts. You can be employed as someone who meets up at work, someone who works hybrid or someone who is only remote, only working from home. So it's a choice you can make from the start. And then we also work more and more with neurodiversity and that people are different. And yes, there are some people who can only deliver if they have the same desk with the same view and three screens and so on. And that's fine. There has to be room for that. I've heard you say, Liselotte, one size does not fit all. And that's what's at stake here. It's about, as we've talked about, supporting the individual and getting the employee to grow and learn and absorb knowledge and have a good time. And in that way support people more than it's just about absorbing resources from the person and the employee. So to support it in the best possible way is important. And then we have to make sure that there are people who have very specific needs. And if we now talk about human growth in the future, Claus, and I am burned out with stress and I have also had some big back problems. So can I throw you in the right as a company, because you are my human growth officer, you are not my experience officer anymore, you should get me to grow as a person. What has gone wrong? How far do you think the company will go in the future in relation to not just listening to what we say, but giving us what we need? I hope it will go much longer, and then just in extension of what you just talked about. Some of my pet peeves is that we have a lot of introverts and extroverts. Yes, all of them are eitherverts, and there is no continuum between them. But for example introverts, maybe 20-30% of our workforce is introverted. So if we force them to work in the office for high energy meetings, we might not get the best out of them, if they don't get other opportunities. The same with A and B people. I think that a lot when we talk about workplaces and the physical place, there is also the whole dimension of when you work. And then you just have to note, and it is scientifically proven, that if you are a B person, you don't have it tip top in the morning at 8 o'clock. But if you force these people to meet at 8 am, maybe they have bought small children, then we are not going to keep them or get the best out of them. Then they sit with jet lag and have a bad experience and may not feel that they perform. And I think that is a way to get stressed. So if you can take more care of them, that's what we should do. And mom, I just want to say that I forced Lars to come up here early this morning. Yes, I will probably find a way to do the re-calling. Do you have a question for Lars? Yes, I will probably find a way to do it again. Do you have any questions, Lars? Yes, I do. There is a big open space called tolerance. There is research that shows that people put a lot of effort into it and work more if they feel they are being shown permission. There was a famous experiment with IBM where they told people, from now on you can decide for yourself how many holidays you want to have and when. And thus you communicate that you will no longer be a target of your efforts but of your results. And the reaction was that they were less busy when they could choose how much they wanted. And I don't really know how it continued, but when you try to make jobs and offer greater flexibility and the possibility of flexible amounts of home work, or whatever it is that we do, then some will abuse it, but others will be very happy. So there will also be some kind of division of the workforce, where you find out who you can do it with and who you should not do who not? Yes, exactly. We work with the Heart Association, who started a work life experiment a few years ago before lockdown. Fortunately for them, their employees were so agile and ready to work flexibly. But at the time they started, they had to take one day off a year. But when they set that free, people took two days off a year. So to say, I really think on a trust and... But Lars also has something else, Frederikke, which I can recognize as the worst boss you can get. Because it's not others that make me fall out of the corner. It's me who has a voice in me that says, you can put an hour more in, because all the limits are floating. And there's no one stopping me. And then I actually fall out of the corner and end up being a terribly bad investment both for myself and others. And especially the younger employees, you talk about that there is also a need for recognition and we can see that especially younger employees would like to be seen working, they would like to be seen sitting at the office working. And we have to take care of that, especially when you have access to work from home, and control in a way that it is not too much. Claus? I agree, because this confidence to set it free, it obligates a workplace. And you can say that some can act in it and thrive and perform fantastically, and others need more help. And I think that help is to guide people, but then it is leadership. There is still leadership in the workplace of the future. That's good you say that, because you have there have been many business books lately about how we can be leadership-free or that artificial intelligence can take over. But I'm in high doubt about that. I actually see that leadership is more important than ever because you need to be helped to be guided, motivated possibilities that you didn't know you couldn't be. I have a question for both of you. You have a scale where on one side you are referred to earlier, IBM that communicates, you are measured on what you perform, how and when, whether you do it from holiday or you hold a holiday. It is not our business, you must manage it yourself. And then on the opposite end of the spectrum, there are those who say it is forbidden to read email outside of work hours, because then you will be able to relax. So one is an expression of maximum tolerance, and the other is, in my opinion, an expression of maximum disdain. No, no, care. Yes, that's the question. Is it care or is it disdain? One of the problems we have in relation to science-based work, which we have a number of, is that it is super difficult to measure productivity. We can try, but it is perhaps the few who have actually succeeded. And that means that you can keep working. It will never be enough in some way. The question is whether you can't have these things at the same time that you have some principles for how you work. For example, you limit when we email each other. You don't have to be always on. You don't have to check your email on weekends. For me, it can exist, while trying to focus on what comes out of it. So, not necessarily oppositions, but I'm not sure that's what you're after. You're moderating it, so you're describing that you don't have to read your email on weekends. It's not the same as not having to read it. You get pulled into debt if you read your email. But the two things you highlight, Lars, may not coexist. One is full confidence. That's what I work best for. that I can use a form a day to train before I go to work. But if I don't have to read my emails and reply to them in the evening, I won't be able to get out of it. So it's either or. Either you say, we recommend that you don't work in the evening, weekend and within this time frame, but you can decide for yourself. I want to hear you, because we have to round up two things. What has changed the most in 2050 and do we work more, less or differently? The technology, how it can support and help us, we can't predict how much of a change it will be. That's one thing. I don't think we work less, but very differently. I think we work more effectively in some areas. I hope so. I could imagine that we worked less. Less but better? Yes, more relaxed and the technology can help us. As architects, I see the biggest difference in that we go away from from having these physical domiciles, these physical rooms. We will of course go back to architecture, but we will step into the digital rooms. And I think we will see the digital rooms designed to reflect. Now we are sitting in all those deadly hour meetings under lockdown, where the user base is horrible and doesn't represent the company you work for or is not exciting or stimulating in any way. I have some pretty funny backgrounds. Yes, but you do. And you also know that you have to have the light from the right angle and stand active. But with an avatar, a way to hold meetings where we are in a digital space that is designed from the company's values. So we go from physical spaces that we can cannot ignore, the more we are in a digital space, the more we need physical nourishment and stimulation. So the physical world is blending together with the virtual one. And one could also imagine that some of the things we get in the virtual world we want to have in the physical world. Just as we want something from our home on the workplace, and we talk about privacy, then we might want some of the little things we can play with when we build a virtual office. Yes, in the virtual world we need it to be better connected to our physical world. And we keep the physical world. We just need less office space. Thank you for being with us. Imagined as the workplace of the future, where the ideas of regenerative management have become the norm, and where sustainability and integrity are the basic principles of a true success. The turnover is not only measured in crowns and medals, or in the employees' interest, but also in the growth of the employees as contribute positively to society and the environment. The mentality at the workplace has changed from minimizing damage to improving, regenerating and preserving. And the whole workplace is designed to bring health, learning and creativity. Well Lars, we still have to go somewhere when we make podcasts in 2050. Not necessarily. You can easily a podcast remotely, and I make a lot of them. But if you can do it, then it looks like you're in the same place, without necessarily being there. But is it just as cozy? It's not just as cozy. I would just say it's completely overrated. We have talked about how different people are and we have different ways of working. I am one who is very efficient when I move while thinking and listening. I know some people who work best with a computer when they sitting at a café. It's bizarre, but they love it when they are surrounded by people. I know a leading Danish businessman who likes to sit at a brown café where someone has been drinking all night and then he writes some crazy stuff. So the flexibility you can create there is potentially extremely valuable. And it matches with a super trend that is completely ongoing for society. It is that fixed frames are being released and it will be released in smaller objects and it becomes much more flexible in all possible ways. I saw a pretty funny one that is a nightclub at night and then it's a museum in the daytime. It's a tech museum in Amsterdam, where I thought that was smart. So there are some people who meet up and they work at the up at night, bartenders and DJs. Yes, more and more in Zug there is a Porsche dealer, which is a restaurant in the evening. You sit between the cars and eat. It works well because it's a pretty cool car. And the mail cars, they go out to pack mail in the morning and in the morning. And then they are rented by Mikros, who use it to deliver food to people. So the fact that you use the same thing for two or more different purposes will certainly become more widespread. There are are new ways to work, especially within science. I know a friend who has a venture fund in Utah. He lives in Park City. There is a center where investors, entrepreneurs and business people meet. It's a club environment, very nice, but they do business. There's another project in Verbier called Nest, where they talk about doing something at Cap Ferraro in London. It's a clubhouse where business is done. I don't know if it's Ernst & Young in 20 years or another science company that has some amazing centers in Ibiza and other places where people can come and then they can stay on vacation while they check in and work. So it feels like a vacation. But still, you get to spend the most people have maybe six hours where it can be super creative about the day. Not twelve, but then you get to do the six hours where you are very energetic, but the other hours you are out and about. So I think that there will be more with it. You give employees the opportunity to be together for many days, in semi-holiday-like forms, while it is also work. And then they get super good social interaction. And then at other times, if you are going to sit with an Excel or PowerPoint or write code, then there is no reason to sit with others. You would rather do it all alone, maybe with no sound or where you just listen to your own music or something like that. So the possibilities, there will always be invented new ways to achieve. And it will be very fun to follow. And then I will say the last thing. Frederikke talked about the architecture that should be varied. Because it stimulates people's senses and creativity. The light should be different colors and textiles and everything else. And it's about why we keep holidays in middle age cities when we can build these modern concrete buildings with glass and so on. It's because we like the variety where you think what's going on around the next corner. It's like it should remind as much as possible of nature and be experiential. Shouldn't we just go out into nature and work? Yes, there are outdoor schools where children are taught all year round outside nature. Yes, we go to outdoor workplaces. Yes, so there are insanely many exciting things along the way. I also have to ask you, Lars, because I know that people are listening to this and thinking, will I get to work more hours or less hours or otherwise? What do you say? I say that people get a greater opportunity to choose. I think that's the primary answer to this. So you can really choose to be all in and some will choose it as be materialistic, but many will do it because they love their work. And then we also have a population that is getting older and older in China, in Denmark and other places, where we do not have the means to lose them as resources. So if we do not give the opportunity for you to scale up and down over time, then they will lose some of their talents. Yes, that's another dimension where the boundaries will be washed out in such a way that fewer and fewer people will have a hard retirement age. They will just start doing more gig work and step down gradually, but they will never get up. I have a grandfather who, when he died at a high age, we found out that he was about to get a patent. And I think more of that will come in the future. Yes, John Goodenough,ough won the Nobel Prize for making a lithium battery when he was 97. He was fired from my old university in Oxford when he was 66, because he needed a pension. He spent 30 years developing something the world needed. Now we are talking about jobs. We are going going to the Dyn-round. Is it nice to have a physical place where you can get feedback fitness, where you train your nervous system, where you are together with others? Or can we live without it in the future, towards 2050? There are exceptions in our own venture fund. Is it nice or neat? Generally it is neat to have some common places where you meet. And that's because you have an assumption that culture eats strategy for tomorrow's food. A company that doesn't have a company culture is very difficult to succeed in. And to get a culture, people must meet. We had the first home work day of the year in 2013. And then there was a pandemic and everything to rush up in rush into what we usually do and it's still really hard and there are some who want to go back to the past because we knew what we had, as we also heard Claus talk about. So is it slow or fast in terms of changing the framework around our workplaces? Will it be fast now? I don't think it's something that's going as fast as many of the other technologies and phenomena we're talking about here. It went incredibly fast just after and after covid and now there's a fight about whether we should roll it all the or where. But in the long run, I think there will be massive changes in how people typically work and how you adapt to it. If I say to you, Lars, do you have any good advice for me to invest in these future jobs? Where should I put my money? I think you should put it in the companies that are best at understanding the opportunities and problems in this. So it's not about special providers, it's more about who is capable of navigating this field. And, eh, do you become rich, sustainable, clever or capable? You become it all, actually. I think it runs on all tangents. Is this a big trend? It's a very big trend. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends.

So there is a long way between what you think you want to do and what you actually do. I think it's more likely that it's not people who come with the orders, but it's only the intelligence programs. So in reality, technology is there today. What is it for the Danes when we look forward? Your home is where you hang your hat. It can be our home. So your home is a feeling. It's not necessarily a place. No, not necessarily, because we can take it with us on many sides. That's probably the worst question you've ever asked me. This is Supertrends. The program where we inquire about all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author, a father, two children, with a kitchen, a living room, a bedroom and a bathroom. Fortunately seeing a new approach to working life, health, fitness and technology and we will be tripping our equipment. Welcome to an episode of Home Against 2050. Lars, according to Danish statistics, every Danish lives on an average of 53.6 square meters. That was down to 43 square meters in 1981. At the same time, our families have become much smaller. We have of course had more singles. In 1981, there were 2.5 people per household. Today there are 2.1. Do you think that trend will continue with us having more and more square meters per nose? Or do we get those tiny houses? I think we get more and more square meters per nose. And of course not everyone is involved in that. All the way to 2050? Yes, I think so. And it's because when I look into our future predictions, I conclude that the world will be much more prosperous. And one of the things people value a lot is living really well. I can't help but think, if you only live in this house, and you get the intelligent walls you love to talk about, can't you just say, now it's a bathroom, now it's a kitchen, now it's a fitness room, then you don't need the square meters. When I read from the Supertron machine, you will hear that people like to have a biograph, they like to have a little fitness room, people have all kinds of different special wishes, places to have their clothes or something. So I think in that direction it is possible, then people would like to live better through Snitly, that is to say bigger. I can at least see one thing from Bolius, who I have also worked with, that when you interview families, they say that when the children move home, we move to something smaller. It just doesn't happen. So there is a long way between what you think you will do and what you actually do. Yes, it's also about keeping and not having so much to do with how many square meters you have. It's more about how many things you have in those square meters. So, there are all kinds of household robots. There are still vacuum cleaners and so on. They get ten times better. So it just ends up with you telling your personal AI to fix the house or apartment before you get home. And then I also think that right here in this program we will be talking about a lot of new technologies. We have some exciting guests, but I have at least noticed that ring-clock ring, which has completely revolutionized the market. It films who comes in and out of the door. And what I find interesting is the new behavior. And Dan, I know, who has his whole family to use it. The children who have moved home from it, they still have it. So when he comes home, they write him a text message saying, welcome home dad, because they have seen it live on camera. And when people are out traveling, they also follow up on who is coming in and out of the door. I think it's very interesting. And then it is clarified. I don't know how many criminal things out of this. And if you go on YouTube, you can see the world's bear, not Denmark, that goes up and rings the door. The latest they have found is that if you manage to catch an alien on camera, you earn one million dollars. Yes, I actually it this morning and I thought it's simply brilliant marketing. So now all people will go completely up, first they find out what Ring is and then they will go completely up and see their feed and see if there is a little green man with antennas around. I thought it would fit perfectly in the UFO program we are preparing. Yes. Are we going to the timeline? We are. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives a clue as to when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. If you look at the economic history, you can see that on average, for a very long time, the average real standard of living in the world grew by about 20% every 10 years. And besides that, the population also grew, but per inhabitant it grew by about 20% every 10 years. And the population also grows, but per person it grows 20% every 10 years. Now, because of artificial intelligence, large analysis houses think that it will grow probably 30-40% in a period. It will be the growth trend and then maybe it will fall back to where we were. So a background for what I will say now is not only based on a technological development that makes all kinds of especially digital products, but also other products cheaper. But it is also a expectation that we will become richer. And in general, the world population is about 4.5 times richer by the beginning of the century than they are now, where we have already come a long way. So that is the starting point. Then I look at the timeline, and there is a lot. I take some things for example in 2025, there will be over 50% of all interior designers, interior design engineers, they will use smart lighting systems. And smart lighting systems can do anything. There can be something with color change, for example with what you call in English Arcade and Rhythm, that it changes to a little golden light out in the evening, because then you sleep better. But it can also be light that adapts to whether people are near it. And disco light! And disco light and stage setting, mood setting. Press one button button, there is a special atmosphere in the whole part of the house. Do you think you press buttons or can it just calculate it? I personally think that pressing buttons works quite well. I think that's what most people want to do. But some people have it on an app on their smartphone, for it on their smartphone. In 2025, more than 10% of all interior designers will use what we call virtual collaboration tools. That means that you can sit with different people and collaborate with them to set up this home or whatever it is. On an app like Google Docs, for example, where you can collaborate on a document. 2026, you're considering that home security systems will be part of the technology that grows fastest at home. So the same year, 10% of all luxury properties will come available. It's a bit of a fluffy term. But they want private biographies or media rooms. It's something with digital detox. You can have a co-life without screens all the time. And then you make a room that is perfect for having screens. And there are also some who make it into a room where they can make webinars. My daughter, she has just finished setting up a new house in Munich and down in the basement she has made a media room, because she is always on either an internal conference call or webinar. And then she has made the right studio to run it. So it's also something about separating media and then it really does it professionally. And detox, you can put it to lock, as we have long talked about, those refrigerators that also have to lock certain periods of the day, and then after 18 o'clock the refrigerator is locked. You can choose to do that if you don't have control over it. So in 2026 more than 10% of professional interior designers use gamification. And gamification can be, for example, that you make a design competition for a room. That means that you have have a rented house and then you get a lot of offers. I think it's more likely pretty quickly that it's not people who come with the offers, but it's artificial intelligence programs that just come with 15 offers to rent your home. And then you can make some fantastic apps where you can actually see 15 or 20 or 25 and then you can think, what do see 15, 20 or 25. What do you prefer? This or that? And then it will show you where you are and what kind of person you are. Like with underpants you have Monday's home, Tuesday's home. I think about choosing my home. But I come to something with, you can actually do what you say, so you got a point. In 2027, what is called Augmented Reality Mirrors, that is mirrors, that can add something to what you see in the mirrors, will are expanded. For example, you can have it in your bathroom, where you can see how the weather will look with this and that. 2027, more than 10% of all new luxury homes will also have fitness rooms. And then comes all this with digital coding, and that's something I talk about all the time. It's completely off the rails in Las Vegas with this The Sphere. Hold it up wherever you want. If people haven't seen it, just go in and Google it. I think we should add it. Otherwise there will be one for us, because there will probably be one for London. But it's a whole building, an egg-shaped building, where both the outside and the inside is actually a gigantic screen. Well, you can put that in your house, and that means that you can get to what you want to have, Lieselotte, namely you have a house for the matthews Tjersted and Årnsted. So the walls look completely different. And that means you can also subscribe to art, digital art, from some artist who sets up your walls and then when you get home there is some new art. And that will start a whole new genre, digital coding in Interior Design. And that means you can also do it like that, that it automatically restyles a little bit after what the weather is, how the lights are outside. Or that if you have a triumph in your life, your football team has just scored, then suddenly something completely crazy comes happen on your wall automatically. Then the robots start to come in, and from 2028 there is a expectation that interior architects will really start thinking about householding robots in systems. And there are two kinds. One of One is the one that is inside the house, or maybe outside, but the next one is the delivery robots. There are both of them that might come running down the street, but there can also be some that land on the roof, and that becomes complicated. Then biometrics, that is, you use your eyes or your fingerprints or something else to get access control, it really expands. So there is an expectation that by 2028 half of all interior architects will use it. I have my own device with finger prints and it works perfectly. It takes only 2 seconds and only I can start. Then comes 28% of the sound engineers use design architects use advanced sound systems. That means sound that is very directionally oriented, so it is aimed at the person who is listening. But it could also be anti-sound, which is a shield against noise. And that is called sounds soundscaping when you make such completely arranged sound landscapes. And I don't think I should say much more than 2029 there will be digitally printed wallpaper. So you're almost completely away from being wallpaper, it's something that's in a catalogue. No, you upload a picture and then someone prints it out as wallpaper. That means we can be incredibly creative with our wallpaper. I recently spoke to Lars with a PhD student who has written about privacy and what actually creates a home. I hadn't thought about it before, but the reason it's so stressful to be homeless is that everything is new. You don't know where you get the light from, you don't know how to lie down, you don't know how your bed should look. But the reason we say, when we get home, we say, it's because we know where the plate is, how we get warm, how we turn on the lights and everything is just on autopilot. So I'm not quite sure about that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. I think it will actually stress us a lot, because that's what it's supposed to be at home. It's to give us a spiritual hug where we are up compared to everything else. Now I am looking forward to welcoming our two guests. Although it may be a bit expensive and complicated, house owners who are growing can already today become self-sufficient with energy. But imagine a near future where all houses are connected to a decentralized energy network and self-sufficiency is a gold standard on the housing market. Either because it is an economic win-win for society, or maybe because you can no longer rely on the state's electricity network. By then, the windows in your home are made of solar-powered glass, and the roof is of course made of solar solar cell tile. The house's storage rooms are built of structural batteries made of cheap, easy to use and reusable materials. Every morning the owner's personal artificial intelligence asks you for advice on what you want to use the energy you use today. You can for example sell it for free on the market, donate it for free to the organ victims or learn it when you need it. David Gugelager, you are a media advisor, editor on TV2 and you have looked a lot at the special intelligence at home and what artificial intelligence will bring into it. We will get back to you in a moment. And then there is you Louise Byk-Kongsholm. You are the owner of the PEI Institute or the PEI Group. You are both the administrative director, but you are also a fantastic presenter, moderator, trend researcher and all kinds of other things. Welcome. Thank you. Louise, we were really happy to see your home 50 years ago. What was it that we came across right then? It was the American magazine that in 1950 tried to predict how we would live in 2000. And they hit the mark in a scary way on a number of areas. The picture they made, there is a flat screen. That is, in 1950, we predicted that we in 2000 would have a flat screen. There is a picture of a girl sitting on the kitchen table, either doing social selling, webinars, Facetime, Instagram, TikTok-like things. The only thing that has been a little bit on the side is a helicopter on the roof. But if we now turn it into an electric car or something like... Or those luxury buildings... And then the food comes up in the kitchen automatically, it was also well done. Then there is something about washing clothes that fixes itself. We haven't got to that yet, but we have to fix that. Lars has a suggestion on how to handle that. I would say there is some washing and drying in one. Yes, there can be. But there was a good offer already in 1950, if you think about how you lived then compared to how we live now. Then there are some of these big trends, which is what Lars deals with a lot, that are actually to be foreseen. But they forgot the role of the men, and if you look back, it was the biggest revolution ever. In this old picture, the mother is sitting at home talking to a girl, while her father comes home with his little map from work. From the helicopter. There is clearly something you have missed there. It's a bit too much of a gender stereotype, but I think it has moved really well on everything else. But now you are not only Lars who presupposes trends. You also do that at PEI. So give it a go compared to 2050. What are some new functions our home will have to take care of? I think one of the things that Lars started with, and one of the things that you also talked about with sociologists, is a basic understanding of what our home is. Why is it so important to us, and why do we get the same reasons by spending money on it? We want more square meters, more functions. It's both, as you say, it's a pass, you come home, it should feel good, it should feel safe. It's also a very big part of our identity, and therefore there must be a match between who you are and what the home looks like and is equipped with, otherwise there is not that feeling of now I'm home. You can imagine that you have been visiting someone where their their home is not yours. It feels wrong. So it is the first understanding of the role of the home, that it should be almost one to one of who you are. And then we have, over the past few years, especially with Corona, as an extra touch in the bag, found out that the home has a multifunction. It's both a family place, relaxation, the ultimate detox and restitution, which is sleep. We have found out how important that is, and tons of money has been invested in technology in sleep and the administration of sleep. Do we get our sleep well? Yes, we do. It's all about the focus on sleep. Without it being a taboo to say, I'm going to go into this. I would think there will be three sleep well, there will be a couple of sleep well and then you get two separate sleep well for when there is to sleep through. The whole focus on sleep and then family life with everything that comes and goes. Some families, as you say, 37 with different combinations, weekly weeks. A home should also be able to handle that. Some weeks you are maybe seven or eight, and other weeks you are only three. That means there is some multifunctionality and some flexibility, completely basic. Some dining tables that can be pulled in and out, some chairs that be set up, cars with seats in which we know them. Flexibility, constant adaptation to the number of people, constant adaptation to functions. And as Lars mentioned, all the functions we otherwise need externally, whether it is a fitness center, a sound studio, a conversation with the doctor, or whatever, it all comes into the home. The home becomes a multi-functional house that adapts to our different needs throughout life, no matter how many we are. Big family, small family, and the older we get, the more we have to deal with the fewer stairs, the easier it is to get around and clean up some of the departments. What about the home hospital? It's already on its way. Today you can buy various tests where you can test yourself at home for everything possible. Also make an urine test every day if you want to find out if you lack vitamins. And that development is underway, and if we roll 20-30 years forward, we are home-diagnosed with regard to a number of completely ordinary lifestyle diseases. Then there is another thing I am very curious about, Louise, it is food consumption, because I can see that there are a lot of convenience stores, as you mentioned, on the old picture. We also see that there are babies growing up on some kind of squeezy, small tubes with smoothies in them. That's why you could imagine a future without kitchens with lots of squeezies with the exact ingredients we need for the day. Professor-curd or juice or whatever it is. Or is it dream? But there are many things at stake here. There is both the individual, what do you do wrong and what should you eat to live optimally. That is already running, so I think we will see more of that. But is there room for food production? Yes, there is plenty of room. I don't know how many homes have the so-called conversation kitchen, which is never used. It's something that you had this vision with the thought of the children who are sitting and doing lectures and mom and dad who are cooking and it's not used. The Danes cook twice a month from the bottom, often a Friday-Laturday or a Friday-Sunday combination. The other days it's something like picking up, bringing, frost pizza, eating at different times. But remember, you have very small children who run in a fast routine. So the home is a lot about the dream, the vision, where you want to get something else, is how real life is. And I think there will be a revolution in terms of food delivery. Now I that both Nemlig.com and Bilkær Tilsvarende are testing home delivery and we have a problem with having twice as many supermarkets as we need. So we need a basic rush where half of the supermarkets close and then you can get profitability in delivering goods to the customers. If you think even further ahead, and the two of us here in the studio are better at it than I might be, then it will be something with the goods being delivered, then there is a law outside the home where the driver himself almost clashes it into the refrigerator and the vegetable store and the rest, so the goods are just there. So all the boring things we need to use all the time, toilet paper, toothpaste, milk, green, it just pops up and we get to deal with the fun itself. What is our dream house? When we close our eyes and think, the perfect thing for me would be, what is it for the Danes when we look forward to... A strange combination with close to other people, but preferably sound-isolated so you can't hear them. So it's an apartment or a parcel house? I think if you land somewhere in between a house with a common relationship, you would like to be together with some people of nobility, either through families, generations or some kind of community, but you would rather just want to be at peace. We have a very interesting demographic development right now, where very few children are born. So I imagine, because luxury in the future is always what everyone wants, that it will be that parent-best trend, that it will be so exotic with that baby, that when it finally is born, if it is born and you are lucky to have a baby, then the parents-best will move in right away, so parent-buying will have a new meaning. It is simply mother and father, their children. We already have several of those multi-generation houses where you can just connect and help each other with the life you want to live. And again, it's a luxury because not everyone has such fantastic parents. I also want to have you on the stage. You have dealt with the smart homes and prototypes around Denmark, which are called the future home. What were the experiences with this project? The experience is that we are in that degree. You can say, are we there yet? When we also call it the home of the future, I don't have anything to do with it today, but then you also put it in another direction in relation to, okay, is the home of the future. And what we actually got installed, it was all current products, but also to put it all together. And that's the idea of ​​that smart home, what I smart home, the understanding home. It's the home that has a lot of sensors, a lot of cameras, a lot of units that control one thing or another to the right. And that makes it possible to make it in this way, then it can give a better understanding of the one who uses it. The experience is that we have not come there yet where you can point where everything is installed and everything is part of it. So there is no doubt that we are far from being able to see into it yet. But we can also say that the trends have been there for many years and a lot is starting to happen at this point in relation to what you can do and what we can open up for and what these products can help us with in everyday life. That has been the main revelation. If I look at it from an investment perspective, I think there are millions of billions in getting people, but in their own homes. Where do you see us getting in there and looking at an older population, who can be much better at taking care of their own homes with the help of these technologies? We already see that in other countries than in Denmark, especially in the east, where you focus a lot on what the robots can do in relation to the older version. And that's also what we can look into in relation to the smart home. We're not there yet where the products can help and do the work in relation to lifting and taking the older version. But what it is that you look at, that you have a smart home that has lot of sores, when the windows are supposed to open, when to get out, when to turn on the lights etc. makes us as humans, we can relax a bit more at home. And if you can't do it anymore, because you don't have the mobility you need, then you can get the possibility to use the bed that turns you on when you're talking. So you don't have to go out in that scenario. You can do that today and it only gets better. So it turns you on and throws you on the floor? Yes, that could be great. Or just give you 220 volts when you're lying there talking. That would also be perfect. But in reality, just a little elevation bed, then it just vibrates the bed, which is just the pendant to the album on the side. And it works today and is there to help at that point. In reality, technology is there today. It's just about integration and not least enough more about integration and understanding if you want to do it. A change in the way you behave. It's funny to talk about technology today. I've been thinking a lot about the milkman put the milk in. So we had actually... It was pre-prepared for home delivery and then we opened it from the other side and took it out. So you can do that. Oh yes, but you can also do it today with the home delivery. If it's the one or the other one of your door phones, you can connect it. It's more American and more of a feature, a gimmick, if you will. But the fact that you can deliver the box inside the door, because the parking lot can get the moment code to your door, so it doesn't have to stand outside the door and get snubbed or caught in the wind or rain or whatever, then they can put it in and they can even, I think in the USA it's like that and it's still on so many tests but you know, then they get to know that when they have to go into the parking lot, then they have to put their phone in the pocket as a kind of body cam and then you have to type in the code and then the owner gets a message saying that now there is a bid and put your goods in the fridge and then they have the phone as a bodycam so they can't you know if something is taken or something happens then you have a very good indicator of where it happened and in Sweden these smart locks make a lot of sense. Having a lock at the door, so that when we get home, we don't have to find the key. We can just have our best friend in the closet. The phone will open it all up for us. It makes sense. But in Sweden, this is huge. In Denmark, it's not stay at all. Because we don't experience the same kind of... We still get the insurance and so on, but the insurance takes it all. It doesn't work in Sweden for example. So you have to be able to be safer in this way, because a smart loss is actually safer. It is smarter in many ways. but we Danes, you also said something about the dustpan, I think that is a funny subject, because we have had dustpan all over the years, you can see the picture you show here with the old 1950's picture, where the woman, and you almost get the feeling that the woman is supposed to stand with the dust I'm just saying, it's me who wears boots at home every day, but I wear boots, but an old classic boot. I don't wear robot boots, and that's a classic Danish thing to do. We can see the possibilities out there, but we don't want to do it, because it's still a bit too difficult. It's not quite where we are yet, and development is coming, but it doesn't go as fast as I expected. But if you look at the grasslands, it's a mess with robots. It does. It does. Until it dances down in the lake, you don't like it anymore. I've tried that one. According to Pew Research Center, there is a big difference between European countries in how long young people stay at home with their parents. In Croatia, which is at the top of the list, 76% of all young people between 18 and 34 live with their parents, while Denmark is only 16% of the population. In all cases, it is important that men stay at home longer than women. The reason for this is typically in culture and social bonds, but also the degree of security and welfare in societies. I have Louise Bygholm and David Gulle with me in the studio, together with Lars, and we're talking about the future home, and now we're going to go towards 2050, because we're talking about more square meters and lots of things and lots of geysers. At the same time, we have some young people who experience that our planet is about to fall apart in a massive climate crisis. So I would like to ask both of you, how can we optimize our home? We have talked about positive houses. Can we start producing energy that we can deliver back to the grid? We have war at the moment, so there is also something with supply security. Should we have prepper rooms so that we can manage ourselves if there is an explosion somewhere? It's funny you say prepper room, because it's one of the most popular rooms and which has been taken most pictures of both during and after corona. It's the old virtual room slash breakfast, where you have all your canned food and your sourdough projects. And if you're smart, you've just install a wine fridge. But that's what it is. But the fact that you can basically manage if one thing is that the ultimate prepper, but the ordinary Danish has screwed up hard for what is called the base, seaweed, toilet paper and food in a can so we can manage anything. There is some kind of trigger that. Yes, and we also look at the energy. There is no doubt that we dance quite well in this energy-friendly time where you both get ... It's not many years since they decided that some tile stone could pull electricity down to the house, they were not incorporated and not installed around the house. That's another thing, but the technology is there, and we see more and more of it, that we get some form of self-sufficient units. And not only the products we have at home, they can also help us save on heat. We see that the smart thing at home today is that when you go out the door, the heat goes out and the light goes out. When you are in the bathroom, not much water is poured down. The trend will increase because more and more products will be made. And not only washing only has to run when there is green electricity and in that way we also save on it. And then we also see that the units out there use less electricity, so they can also jump into a self-sufficient unit of some kind. And there are many different ways we can do that, whether it's solar cells, whether we have our own windmill standing on the roof and things like that. There are some ways to do this, whether it's solar cells or having a windmill on the roof. There are possibilities. It's a popular sport this year to track the electricity prices and set the dryer on at night and cook dinner because you shouldn't have turned on the oven. It's just another big thick line that really what really changes behaviour is when we hit a completely ordinary Danish on the money point. That's what it's all about. And then we can have a long talk about whether it will have consequences for the general situation of our society. That something must be done that hits hard and something that is bad for us to change behaviour. Because one thing is attitude, something else is behavior that is behind it. And there is a great discrepancy. So there must be something new built into it. There must be new initiatives and new technology that drives development while the Danes are hit on the money point. Then things happen. Yes, and it is more convenient that it is better, that it is sustainable at the same time. But you are absolutely right, it's the one at the bottom of the Maslow's-Bohor pyramid. If we get depressed about whether we can get our hay, we should probably get it bought. And at the same time, do we have that supply security over time? And you can't just think about when it all becomes so super digital. Isn't it a bit uncertain if there are some who... That was the first thing that came up here in the Israel-Gaza conflict. That's the stream. Can we even manage? How many days can we manage? Is it safe to put our home up on a lot of digital? Well, it's not, unfortunately. But we have not been the safe types ever. We throw ourselves out into some things that we think is smart, is funny, it gives some things on paper, but is it really something that is safe? No, it's not. Just look how how much we have taken cloud solutions to us around in companies. And everyone says, just let me do it, because then they are just more accessible out there. And we say yes to one or the other service, without reading the long papers that say, your first birthday is ours. Yes, that's fine, I just need to go on Facebook. So there is no doubt that when we look at the smart home and connect everything to the internet, we make it more accessible. And there's no one of us who thinks that we can hack our car because it's connected to the internet, or everyone can watch our video camera that we've installed in our sleeping quarters because we want to feel safe. But you can do that today. The car itself is a good example of how we want it to be on electricity, on the internet, it should be able to do all these things. But I saw a fine Wire article or video, where they had just put up, and it's some years ago, where they got hacked a car while it was driving with another passenger. The driver sat and drove along the motorway and two hackers sat in another place, several kilometers away from it, and got hacked into the car and got started on the facility and window wipers and finally disconnected the car car so he panicked because he was driving on the motorway but the car kept on turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and runs out of the house. And my son is not even home. He has simply gone in and taken over the sound system inside the house. So yes, I know that very well. We are good at securing ourselves at that point. We are better at saying, okay, there are some possibilities here, then we try that. We have to move on, we're going out here in 2050, and I don't know what you think has surprised you the most. I can't help but think that there are a lot of gamers, they have a lot of good friends, they put themselves together. Are we really going to live with people we don't know, or should we, as Louise was saying, try to create some communities where we can access things? We want to have our privacy, but we also want to have access to people who lift us, inspire us. More and more people will spend more hours at home because there is flexible working hours. And then it's not the same as when you come home to a sleeping town and who lives next door. Then you suddenly have to meet them with the dogs in the morning and all kinds of other things. How much are we going to get to us and place ourselves in some new forms for people? There will be an uproar in jobs and also in with education, where you don't necessarily have to move to an educational city to take a 3-5 year education, where you meet on Monday to Friday, where it will be more flexible, hybrid, online, digital, so we will be more free. And then the choice of Bopæl will not be controlled by where the education is or the job is, but where we would like to live, regardless of who we are. Whether you are a nature-loving person, whether you love to ride a kayak or ride a horse, or if you are actually a big city person who wants a cafe life and would like to live in a smaller place, then it becomes more of an individual choice than it is controlled by the external factors. But you don't think we will be controlled by friends and family? Friends and family will also be able to make more money than the job. Already now we see that it is the children who make money. Where is the good school girl? Because it's the hardest to get into. Exactly, there are some choices we make, that we make in common about these things. But another thing I find so funny in relation to the communities, is that when we talk about the future, we talk about energy. There are some energy communities where we are gathered around a solar cell market or a solar cell set up that is not just running the one house but running the whole thing at one point. We already see that and it will be much more expanded because we will use some form of collectives. Collectives are also what Louise says, it is maybe the way we move. And this is for some, not for all. But as you say, the children have a big part of that. We can see for ourselves, if you have parents, how much it can give the children to play something. It gives some freedom to the parents. They have more room to do the things they want. And at the same time, you can say that there might not be any office communities at the moment. And that will probably be a big part of it, that office communities are in these communities. So we don't have to go out and sit in an office in the city, but one can sit in this community we all live in and work across the board and then one can be a journalist, the other a doctor and you can still meet in the form of some work scenarios. Lars, you have a question? Yes, I have, because I think the thing about communities and the idea of a council house in our lives is quite interesting and it's also a bit complex, because on the one hand, for example, nursing homes, they have a small apartment, but then there are a lot of things that are common, but that's also a special situation. But now there are growing these types of apartments where there are quite a few common facilities. And that's relevant, because despite the tents, there have never been as many single people, obviously, as there are many common facilities. And that's relevant, because despite the tints, there have never been as many single people as there are now. So to counteract loneliness, you have to go around the corner. And then I think, that's a good idea. But then I also think, on the other side, You can also go to the local café. For example, where I live in Switzerland, there are clubs. Like the English phenomenon with clubs. But there are more and more clubs. And it's not that you live in a place where it's a part of it. But the club you are a member of is not more than a few hundred meters away, typically maybe two kilometers away from where you live. And that's their assembly house. I would like to ask if you have any thoughts about the balance with where it is thought of in a shared home, or if it's just something you find out in another way. We have already seen that there are so many networks today compared to what there has been before, where we have networks, then there are some who cycle, then there are some who, I passed the chess club today, then there are some who sit on that part. So I think we will clearly see that technology can make us strengthen many of these communities and networks. Whether it is physically that we go to a club or do it at home, it is of course difficult. It can be up to a single person, but there is no doubt about it. It's the physical thing I'm thinking about, because we have online. Yes, then there's VR, then we sit there and so on. No, it's that where you're just a few minutes away from a place where there are people you want to be with. Yes, Louise can probably answer that better. If we raise it up in the big picture, and now I don't want to go into the current political debate about the working hours of the Danish people. But we are actually working less and less. If we increase it to 2050, we will be down to 25 hours a week. And that is because there is no need for it. The society can work without it, on some level. But it is because our free time, our network, our communities, our own identity is anchored in what happens away from the job. So it will fill more and therefore there will be need for more communities, a place where you spend the more hours together with someone who is sane. Whether it's chess or mountain biking, board games or whatever it is. So I think it will fill more and more and we will also have time to be part of more communities. So you can have more communities, you are part of physically and online. And then there will be certainly some owners who listen to this program. And what do we tell them? Should we move all the time? Move, buy, move, sell, move, buy? What happens in the year 2050? Or will we be as locked up as we are today, where it's very difficult, it's dangerous, it's bureaucratic, you're afraid, you're in a bind? We lack some digitalization of the whole purchase and sale process and the moving process. Imagine if you could press one button and say, now I'm moving. And then water, heat, electricity, network, people, registers, mud, so you move. We lack that. That's the problem with this. We are talking about a setup that we talk about when we talk about the whole digitization. There is an A and a B group. And there are those who have the smart homes and those who don't get the smart homes. And then suddenly you go from there and say you have optimized your home. Your home optimizes you. It makes you a better person, you think. And there are all those remedies you may have spent an awful lot of money on, because they are not cheap. And then you are there and feel like a queen in your own home. But if you are moving, then there are suddenly far fewer places where you can do it, because not everyone has done the same. And then you have to start from scratch. I am in the same situation myself. I moved a year ago, where I spent a lot of time making it earlier home, to a smart home. And then I start from scratch. Is there money in selling it to others as a smart home, or they can't understand what it means? It's a bit where we live in this time, where we are right now, where we first begin to realize, what can artificial intelligence, what can a smartphone do for me, and so on. So yes, there is money in it, but we are still not there yet, where especially the Danish are ready to do this. But in 2050, we will be more aware of what it can do, but there is still a big difference in relation to the economy, but then put it at home. And that's just a free message from my side. I think we will move less, move less, because it will be more difficult. One, as Louise says, take the moving process. Two, all that we have installed and put up in our home, can't we just take out and move in somewhere else? And then we will suddenly become more aware of what we are moving into. So we have to make some plug and play solutions. And we have that with the students afterwards, where they move into apartments that are fully furnished, there is internet, there is a washing machine, there are services in the buildings, because it should also be easy and you should be able to move if you change direction or move with someone. So it's a little more flexible, at least in the first phases of life, adult phases, and in the latter, where all the midterms, where you are the family of Denmark in one of the 37 combinations, there you need something else. But now you say yourself, you have said earlier, we get more specific rooms, and Lars, you also mentioned that your daughter has made a specific multimedia room, right? And so when we get out of those very specific rooms we have made, and then where we have to find houses, places, apartments or whatever, a home that will contain it all. Our demands are getting more and more specific. They are getting heavier and heavier, bigger and bigger, more expensive and more expensive. And it's getting harder for us to get our hands on something. And not least, it's up to plug and play. I can say that while you are young and maybe on your way up, also economically, and trying to find out where you should end up, you have a preference for something that is super easy to move into, which is premium furniture and all that is just plug and play. And then you save up for your own and your own. It becomes something you put so much in that you don't want to leave it again. I just can't understand what you're saying. I think technology is developing so fast that even though you thought you were super fast back then, it's just so fast that you think all that old crap. And I think we get some leasing, i.e. service models, so we get home, i.e. service. We just lack someone to fix it. I agree with Louise that we need someone who moves for us, someone who optimizes it in relation to our health profile, in relation to our interests in our free time. So it's simply thought through and then we should take it more as an appointment. Because I would also like to have it when I travel and in the summer house. And I could also think of that to hear, because now we have Airbnb and we have different holiday models that are coming out, so you don't buy one summer house, but ten summer houses, because you get to share it. Could you imagine getting all these nomads who live much more hybrid? I would like to take a month off in Aarhus, for example. That could be very fun. I think we will see more of it, and it is double-tracked, especially this one with the summer house, where the Danes have hampered the summer house too much in recent years, and now there are some who are burning the candles, because the rent is stalled, and they have found out that there is also a summer house that needs to be painted. And the weather is bad. And the weather is bad, it rains in October, piss. But it is double-tracked, because you have to rent and you have to be your own and now it's there we're holding summer vacation and when you've been there four rainy weeks in a row, then you sell shit and want something else and then the other one pulls, so I think it's quite double-tracked, but this one, come and go, leasing, access, subscription, we will of course see more of. What has surprised us most in 2050, David? Well, it is probably that things will get better at that point. Technology will understand us better. Today it is still us who need to understand technology, but technology will understand us. Just look at the development of customer intelligence, as it is at the moment at the moment. That we are surprised about what we can do in close production. And we will see that much more when we talk about smart homes, in relation to that it is a home that makes you get a better everyday life. Because it can be part of setting the right mood for you when you enter the room. Then the lights turn on in the right way, or set the right lighting when you're in that mood in the bedroom, or whatever it may be. Turning on the coffee machine yourself is fantastic. It can't be. No, it's too extreme. So it's clear, I think what comes to us is that the ease there is, hopefully at least, the positive access to ease there is in using the the technology at home. Then we also get more free time for what we would rather want. Again, the interest in the identity that lies in the other, because the robot planer and the robot vacuum cleaner run, it all works for you. I would like to think about the technology and hear from you Louise. What is happening culturally? You said that no one uses the conversation kitchen. Are we sitting in our bubble, in our Ready Player One universe at that time? Or do we play board games and kisses and hugs like never before? And you may not not just got one real man, but three. Three? What are we supposed to do with them? Where are they going to live? Yeah, we can take that aside. But we get pretty desperate. And it's funny to read our behavior, that we become more and more digital. And as you say, it's the opposite that's always interesting. We go mucking in board games games and start knitting and crocheting and go to the garden to get that game back. It's a desperate attempt to create some kind of balance, because you think, wow, this digital world is dangerous and it destroys me. But that's the way it goes. You've seen more pictures of people sitting on their sofa at home with every iPhone and living in every world, but they are still together. It's just another way of being together. Yes, we sit with our glasses on and have our experiences of a cool movie, a sports movie and something romantic. Is it really the way we go? It becomes more individual. Is home more important for us or less important? More important. More functions. Yes, we can just see that in relation to the technological development. It is the way we are going in relation to. It is something you can take with you. Now you are also talking about Airbnb. When we are in the hotel room, it becomes more of a home you go into. You go yourself home. It's a personal choice. Your preferences are already there. So the feeling is that your home is where you hang your hat. So the home is a feeling, not necessarily a place. No, not necessarily. because we can take it with us on many different levels. Nice ending comment. Thanks David for being here. Thanks Louise. Thanks. Thanks. According to Elon Musk, there will probably be a humanoid robot in all homes by 2050. And technology will in general mean more to us than the car does today. But what kind of robot could assist us in at that time, if the development of artificial intelligence follows the curve and we choose to rely entirely on robot technology? It could be anything. From the automation of household and daily necessities to childcare, tutoring, private teaching of language, motion or musical instruments, assistance in the kitchen, shopping, garden work, elderly care, medical care or as a security guard. Lars, what do you say? I have a house fetish. I dream about living in a house. It's my ball game. I think it's really interesting. But one thing I think you can see, or a couple of big supertrances that are almost everywhere around us, is that new technologies often start with a certain object that has to deliver a practical function. So there is a big bird that stands there, it is not particularly popular. For example, the old television they were also big, ugly beacons. And then they started to make them flat, and then they started to design them nicely, B and O for example. Then suddenly it became some design statements. But the next thing that often happens with such objects is that they disappear completely. That means you can see it with your glasses, project it directly into your eyes or contact lenses. But also you get a digital wall and then you say, well, shouldn't we just watch a movie? And then you point at a place, so part of the wall is suddenly a screen. So I think that something that we will also see in 2050 is that there things will disappear, like book reels and LP racks. Book reels with LP and CD are also gone, DVDs are gone and so on. Even more things will disappear. But the other thing is that home will become very effective, as we have talked about with different technologies. And it is true that these lawnmowers, robot lawnmowers are very popular, also because you do not have to empty them in the house as dustbin. You have to empty them. It is a little more complicated, but Elon Musk and others are working on making these versatile home robots that can do almost everything, and then your artificial personal area will be more stable. You have to talk more about your home, because Lars doesn't have a walk-in closet, he has a walk-in champagne closet and a walk-in wine closet. Will that also be the future? Yes, I think, for example, I once made a house in Mallorca, and the architect asked me where the fridge should be, and he said, you shouldn't use fridges in such houses, it's a walk-in, you go into a fridge. So in order to make things bigger, people would want to have a walk-in media room. And now we're talking about a media room as one thing, but there are two things. Because you can have a media room, actually three things. Because a gaming room has one format, one where you have to watch a movie has another format, but one where you have to do webinars has a third format. So there will be these dedicated spaces that are very functional and where you can do some things. They don't have to be really big. It's a bit of a crazy question, but is home nice to have or need to have? That's probably the worst question you've ever asked me. I think it's need to have. Agree. Does it go slowly or fast with that home thing compared to the way we usually do things? It doesn't go very fast, and it's never done before. I would say some of the electronic things will go relatively fast, and some of the other things will go relatively slowly. Is it difficult or complicated to invest in? I would invest in Louise's idea of making the Plotnplay faster and moving, and that it is all so bureaucratic and so busy today. There are lots of start-ups that make things and there are lots of established companies that work with this. So it's relatively easy to invest in. Rich, sustainable, smart. All three things in their own way. So is home a supertrend? The upgraded, still better home is definitely the huge Supertrance. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrance.

Then I could suddenly work without overdoing it a hundred times faster. Where the change may come is that we will train a little more individually. So instead of 20 people training for half an hour, 20 people train for half an hour, but they do something different for half an hour. To get the joy that sport gives, it's a top-notch investment. Because there's a lot of money and interest in finding something entertaining. 40% of the young people don't want to watch football anymore. It's too slow. This is Supertrends, where we investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrend person and create unforgettable moments. But what does the future look like for sport and fitness? You should look forward to meeting our two experts, Gustav Salinas, who is a personal trainer and influencer, and Niels Henrik Sørensen from Sportstech Innovation Lab Denmark. Together they cover both motion and mastery against 2050. Lars, I just watched the documentary with David Beckham on Netflix. It's crazy how he gets put on the spot, because he gets the red card in a fight. And vice versa, how much he gets... ...given away and gets... ...golden balls, as his wife Posh Spis says in a talk show. What makes sport so valuable a business? It has everything. First of all, because it's a game, it's exciting. But on top of that, you can feel the people who make it. You can see their disappointment, their triumph, their compassion, their doubt, etc. Even though they are not very good at explaining it in interviews, but you can see it when they do it. So it is really, really humanly engaging. You often talk about, Lars are becoming more and more peaceful and less into war. It is important to have sport, I think, to get rid of the war feelings. Yes, of course, because it is true that we are becoming much more peaceful and we have been for thousands of years. But our genes haven't changed that much, so we need something to bang. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, who in combination with artificial intelligence, give a signal when future groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. I read about sport and am interested in sport and the sports world in general. I can see that there are some things that are not in the timeline, but that will most likely happen. So I will just say it in broad terms. It is that there are some who will come in and rewrite the rules for some of the different sports. Examples of completely new sports have been American Gladiators and now called American Ninjas and Red Bull has made a lot of sports formats that are very entertaining. I like to watch Formula One, but I get almost tired of it because first of all he starts in the lead and he ends in the lead and so on. There is too little happening and it would be easy for Per to write the rules. I think we should also talk about a well-known football player from Brazil who has tried to redefine football. I think we should take that into account. But if we take the more concrete, then in 2024 there will to our timeline with prognoses, the performance data from professional athletes will be much more common than the one shared with the audience. That means that while watching a match, you can see a lot of data in real time about how the different performers perform. But that also means that when they are traded as goods, you get a much better picture of both how they perform and their market value. They get a digital layer where you can see exactly how much they are worth. Yes, and I have some forecasts later that relate to what you can use. They can also use the data themselves, it's not just them who are dealing with them. So in the same year, that is 2024, half of all fitness enthusiasts use some form of platform that is based on AI to improve their personal work-out plans. Then there is also 2024, when about 10% of all new luxury buildings have a designated fitness room that is well equipped. And again in 2024, that you have artificial intelligence platforms that combine your genetics. People can take a quick swipe in the mouth and get it sent in, and then they can find out about their genes, and that also tells us a little about what kind of sports they should do. So you can control controlled with artificial intelligence, if it has received information about one's genetic. So in 2025, it is estimated that one live and die, we do not know who, but it is a prognosis, one live and die of variables, it can be for, for example rings, wristbands or something else, or a smartphone, which is able to play music that automatically synchronizes the rhythm in the music to the rhythm in your exercises. It's pretty cool. Think if you do interval training where you switch sprints and lunts and then it just goes up and down for the music and energy in accordance with how you do it. Same year, about 10% of all sports coaches use what is called biomechanics, that is to say that you use some methods to analyze exactly the movements you make. For example, using some trackers. You swing your arm to tennis and it says you swing it wrong. Then we have 20-25, that it will be very common to have what is called video walls. in both home gyms and professional gyms. You can buy a video wall already today. You buy a mirror, so it appears as a mirror, but you can activate it with your phone and suddenly there is a trainer. And then you look 20 kg lighter. It doesn't do that, but it could do that. But then there is a trainer, either you are just working on some fixed training programs, you can also get individual coaching, that is to say, you are maybe in Denmark, but there is a trainer in Pakistan or in the USA, who trains you online and talks to you in your mirror. And in your language, because it is simultaneously translated. Yes, it can also be a deepfake. Plus there are cameras that check if you do it right. If it's a trainer, then the host will tell you if you do it right. If there is no trainer, then there is no camera. It can be via a camera, then the application can say, you can tell the camera that the arm should be watertight. 2025 we will have a bigger integration between physical and e-sport. The prognosis is that there will be events where there are at least one million viewers who see an integration between the physical and the electronic. Then we have what is called predictive analytics where you use algorithms to analyze how to make the best team or how a team should play against a specific other team.'s really starting to get interesting. There is a super cool Netflix documentary about... It's called Moneyball. It's about Oakland Athletics, which is a baseball team, where they have a hopeless team and they have no money. And then they get a mathematician in and he calculates how they can buy some other, a bit out of date, a bit cocky players. But each of these players is pretty good at one thing and then he sends the right team together mathematically and then it goes really well for them. So 2025, now we come back to statistics on how you perform. It starts to become common that professional athletes have algorithms that tell them what they probably should be doing in the market. And that is based on what they have participated in, but also on their performance in real time under the different things. Yes, while they are training. Yes, plus maybe also how many followers they have on social media and so on. So the algorithm that is based on this and that, so that you can earn a lot. How good they looked at night, how cute their friends are. I don't know if it counts for how you can monetize it. But then we have in 2025, when you have what is called Personal AI, that is to say an AI that follows you Liselotte and knows everything about you because you let it do it. That it is able to make a fitness program for you and then it says what, what you need now, Liselotte, I will make it for you. And the next thing is, when you enter a fitness room, your personal AI will talk to these machines and the machines will talk back again. That means, it thinks you need to do some special exercises. So it communicates with the machine. And what you have done on the machine, it remembers. And if you are a day trainer in another fitness room, then your personal AI knows what you have done in the first fitness room. So in that way it becomes much more varied. It's a bit like you have step counting, but now you also have apps that count how you run, how you lift weights and all kinds of other things. Then in 2027 you have a big growth in training markers that are robots. That is to say you play tennis or something else with a robot. And then you can code the robot to play like the normal partners or the normal trainers. In reality, it can also be done completely algorithmically. But very often you want to do something interactive with another person, but the person is not there and then you can do it with a robot. And yes, then I think we can finally jump to two a little further forward. It's 2033. There is something called Smart Playing Surfaces. It is a training subject in a sports hall, for example, is able to register what is happening and visualise it really well, so you can see, for example, where people have run and then you can see if there are any areas that are not covered, for example. And then in 2050, most cities, now we are entering a city planning, most cities in developed countries will integrate plans for how people can do training and wellness in the city landscape. I think it's a good idea to really think about it. When you take the technological development into consideration, here are three points on three sports trends that could have been in 2050. 1. Olympic games for cyborgs, where people with bionic prostheses, exoskeletons and biotechnologically optimized sensory apparatus are shining in athletic disciplines on levels where traditional biological humans cannot be. 2. Room Quidditch Imagine an intermediate between lacrosse and the witch sport from Harry Potter, just with jetpacks designed for weightless conditions, where athletes try to score goals on special stages that are in the course of our planet. Thank you. How has your own journey been and the experiences you've had, how has it shaped your way of motivating others as an influencer? I've been working with fitness for almost eight years now, but I would say that first of all I'm incredibly happy to be here today, because I'm interested in the art of art. And my life has changed completely since the art of art came. Since January. The reason is that when the art of art came, I could work without overdoing it a hundred times faster. Of course, it resulted in me having to fire some of my employees, because I didn't need them. A good example is that I had a bootcamp here two months ago, where I was going to Spain. Normally, I spend four days on making training programs, making playlists and doing all this When I got into my chat GPT4+, I wrote down that I wanted to make playlists for 5 days. These women are between 50 and 60 years old. It has to be music they know, it has to be fun, it has to be 45 minutes, make training programs., these general back problems. It took maybe 5 minutes and then I had my whole work done. So in that way my life has really changed positively and I think it's fantastic that you can use these things. And sometimes I wonder why there are not more people who use all the technology. And I think it's like when you open a lung and count. Where life is just easier for people. I think there are just a lot of people who are afraid of it. But I think you just become smarter and I think it only benefits us all. But how important is your own role as a role model? Now you are standing here with the most beautiful words and arms I have seen for a long time, Gustav. Shouldn't you also be the change you want to see others? Can you write these programs and then automate them? Doesn't it mean a lot that you are part of the process and the experiment? Yes, but I think that TAT-GBT or just in general, that you get knowledge much faster. I remember when I was in school and had to learn to be a cosplayer, there were many things that were similar. Where you can say, here you just get to the core, you get to know what you need to know. But I can also see a lot on social media, or at least in various papers, where people write, now you can make your own training program. Yes, you can, but you also have to understand it. That's why I still think there is a need for personal trainers, so you can explain it. And I think a combination of personal and technological is fantastic. I don't think you just stop using the personal trainer because you need it. I have have a clear comment to that because I have had personal trainers for many years and as I had once a week and I have gone into the same fitness room and run after the same program. The huge huge difference is that when the trainer has been there, then I have been soaked. And when the coach hasn't been there, I'm just standing there. And I get to do all of that. It takes twice as long as I enjoy watching TV. I think it's our social life. It's so important for us to be okay in other people's eyes. So I ask myself, because we can in a year's time turn you into an avatar. So you come up as a hologram and you are not there in reality, but all your thoughts and attitudes and all that registered. I still think it means something that you are there. I think I can I can see that in relation to, I have an app, I have a health app where I automatically say, now you have to remember to update, now you have to remember this, now you have to remember that. I can see that people don't update that quickly. If now it's a personal process that I have, one to one, then they automatically update every Monday, because then they know that if they get a personal message from me, they will get bad news. And you don't get that bad news in the same way when you know it's a computer. So it's like, well, whatever. So that means a lot to us. And then you have this brand that you follow. Can you make yourself a global brand now, where we can use these LLM models to translate you to any language you can speak in Japanese? I'm working with my own computer. I have my own app called Celina's Health, which I'm working on my own computer, I have my own app called Celina's Health, I'm working on making my own computer out of all the things I've written with all my clients for many years. So if you want to ask a question, they talk like me. But it takes a long time, but I also dream of being able to make them in all kinds of languages, and you can do that today. And that's fantastic. I've tried to make my own little robot where I can speak Turkish and Pakistani. You can speak any language today. And then I think about in relation to fitness, it's a lot about standing next to each other and training, but you don't train against each other. Could you imagine getting more gamification? I'm a completely different person than Lars is, and you are. But could you do something like a golf handicap? So we can start fighting against each other. You have a whole group. I think in general, and I can see that in fitness, I can see that when I asked Lars before, how much do you bench? I can clearly see when we four go down and train, and we can see that one of us is a little harder, then you have to push yourself. So we can like to push, we can like this competitive genius. So I think if you could do it that way, I think it could motivate more people. Against 2050, Gustav, how do you foresee that the whole influencer landscape will change? What do you see in relation to social media? What's new there? We often experience, at least in the universe I'm part of, that there are big influencers in relation to fitness who have many customers and they make sure that's what you do because you look up to the future. And I think that will happen a lot more. And I also think that when we talk about artificial intelligence, that you will be able to feel that you have a recipient in a closer way. Because as Lars also talked about, then you feel that it is the person you are talking to, but then it is still just a robot. But you have a feeling that it is a recipient. How many details do you need in relation to helping your customers? How much do you need to know about them if you could know something about their psyche and their social life? How many tangents do you want to go in and play on? Because in a little while, it will get an augmented layer of information. It's a crazy thing. I remember many years ago when I started, I was sitting with a piece of paper and I was counting how high and how much I was. I had no time to think about all the small details. Today you can get so much information, so the plans you can make today are much more detailed than they were ten years ago. So when people say it's impersonal, that you use your intelligence to make your plans, on the contrary, it becomes much more personal. You get the opportunity to do it in more detail. So, how many details do you think are involved? I think it's all about how much you sleep, if you have sex, if you're sad, if you're angry, if you're doing well at work. Everything will play a part. And then you make music that answers to exercises? Yes, but you can just see that when I was in Spain, I would never have wanted to spend so much time on finding music for these ladies, who had some hits in the 70s and 80s, but I could just do it in two seconds. And I could see when I was training with them, oh my god, that song was from my happy twenties. So it just gave something. I'm getting a little tired, Lars. I'm going to the gym next time. That we already live in the future is sometimes more clear than others. It becomes so, for example, when we look at Australia, where the world's first sports series of flying electric racing cars is about to start. The vehicle is called Airspeeder MK4. It is 4 meters long, has a top speed of 360 km per hour and is protected by a virtual power field powered by LiDAR and radar technology that prevents them from colliding. The vehicles are still remote controlled on test basis, but brave human pilots are ready in the background and hope to jump in as soon as possible. I also want to have you on the stage, Niels Henrik. What are the biggest changes you see in the world of sports? And now we have talked a lot about personal training and fitness, but if we look at the world of sports and the world of sports, then I know it has been a bit difficult to get people into the club, for example. I don't know if it's difficult to get them in, but of course there has been a long period and Corona has been a bit tough on us. But it has also shown that the relationships are strong, so there are actually a lot of people who have turned back. But in terms of technology, it's two-sided, or there are many sides. But one is very much about the performance part. How good are we at it? How fast should we run? Should we run a little faster? And quite a lot of us have measured and weighed everything physical for many years. And I think the biggest change we see now is the acceptance of it. So the fact that you dare to take it into use, you accept it, it has a value. Sports and the conservative, it takes time, but I think that acceptance is coming now. There is already a lot of doping, and you can't do that. But what if we can go in and do some brain training exercises and change a little, maybe even print a new organ? Is it doping if it doesn't have side effects? That's a good question. And that's where the big challenge lies. It's not only in the sports world, it also applies to other areas. But technology and development are far ahead of the regulations. So can laws and regulations follow the development that is happening technologically?, we will be a step behind. And then it can be that it comes from outside, instead of from inside. And then you started with a point D2? Yes, in relation to the performance side. The other part is the fan experience and the attention to detail. And there the technology moves much faster, because you are ready to welcome the fans with even more experiences, even more insight. And that part is actually much more ready and it is also much more commercial, because there is a much greater purchasing power. And there I think something I find very interesting is that 40% of the young people don't want to watch football anymore. It's simply too slow. They play because they have to slow down. And that's something that TikTokers can't get out of. It's simply too slow. So what do you think will come of new formats to attract new types of fans? I think the young people will like it. They don't see it in 90 minutes in front of the TV screen like we and previous generations have done. Now they see the highlights, the goals and all the cool episodes. They do that on multiple screens and matches at the same time. And while they might watch TikTok on one, they have highlights from the football match on the other and talk to their friends on the third. So it's much more integrated. And there will most likely be a whole new platform. So the big change, if we take one more, is how we will will distribute and consume sport already now, but also in the future. Do you have any examples of where you think it will go? I hear that there will be a whole new platform where we will all create content. So when we sit in the stadium, we make small clips. We share them on a screen that we share with everyone else. There may be business models around it. So that it's not just one legal entity that suddenly has the right to send this out to all of us. We all become our own legal entity. It will be super exciting. And what about him, as Lars was saying, who is starting to revolutionize football, so it will be a kind of game with people who come in and perform along the way? Yes, in Spain, Piqué, the former player, is something like that. Well, that's an example of... And Manchester, I think he has played for. He will at least have it Manchester as well. Yes, but that's probably next step. He's a Barcelona boy and has been there for many years. And has also created it out of Barcelona, where they have played these games, a new format. They are not so many players, there is a lot of music, entertainment. It was all digital, you followed it on Twitch and still followed the New Camp with 80,000 people in a physical setting. And that wouldn't happen from within the established football environment, because there is an old culture that we play 11-on-11 and according to these rules, and it's possible that we make a small rule change every 10 years, but then someone comes in and just makes a completely new setup, and we can make a small change every 10 years. But then someone comes and makes a new set-up. And he can do that outside the established organization. But he's not just outside, Gustaf. He's an influencer because he's been a top player himself. So he has that following that makes you move to a sport, and then you can start doing something else and then the followers follow along. I think that's a very interesting direction. Well, I can say that's also what you should think about when you're an influencer. You have power in a way, and you should think about that when you have such a voice. But you also have your finger on the pulse in relation to what the audience wants maybe it's him who's faster to receive. People don't want to sit there and watch passively anymore. It was the sofa generation, like the ones you just had with you. I can only remember a few years ago, when I made some long videos, where I just found out that Gustav, you have to get together. We live in a world where TikTok is 15 seconds long, or you won't catch people. And I can see on my Instagram, if I post videos that are longer than one minute, they just fall like this. 15 seconds, so I can have 200, 300, 400 thousand people watching the video. It's a little scary in a way. It can quickly become a little overwhelming, but I think actually still, because I'm not so afraid that the live experiences will remain exciting. And if Corona has shown us something, then it was at least all people who voted back to venues, to stadiums to be there live. So it's just as much about creating new opportunities in the stadium. So how do we get data down from the player directly up in the glasses with us, even when we're on the set. And the whole experience of being at the live sport, I I will still be far ahead of being online. I agree with you, because we can see that. We can see that everything that is called that we meet, we are physically hungry as never before. Lars just said that it actually meant something for him to be with a trainer of meat and blood and And body language. How important is it that we're here in the studio today, showing each other our muscles? It gives a completely different feel. And just because it doesn't make sense, but 80% is body language, and the joy that happens collectively at a stadium like this is euphoria. So when we get some measuring tools that can show it, I think it will be important for us. So certainly a future where there is small, medium, large, extra large. I think it has become very expensive to follow the football players from home. I always ask my husband if we can cut it off. Will the prices just keep rising? Or now you mentioned that there are some formats that might democratize it a little. Yes, that will come for sure. I don't think anyone who has the right to the Premier League will need to share it with all of us right now. But there may be a democratization in that we are all there and we give something while we are there. So following it from home, yes, it will be expensive. I think there is of course a lot of room for that. But there will also be another business model. There can be 60,000 on the stadium in England. But with the new technologies that are coming, you can sell 500,000 tickets to the best seat in all of Asia. So it's about lowering the price for some others maybe. So there will be, or they will just increase increase the price of the clubs. So there will be new models where new technologies can increase the sales. Not for a Danish Super League club, because they may not have as many followers in Asia, but for the international brands. And now we have talked a lot about football. Now we have to move on. Because what else do you think will come of the new sports screen? Yes, that's the big question. I'm not sure where I have the answer to that. You have come up with some ideas about drone racing and the new AXELATON and others. Some of it is very expensive and can become, but as the robots come. I think it will be a mix. I think we will see the mix between the digital and the physical. The classic sports scene is often very conservative, so by changing the discipline, we will take a player out, so we play a little less, there will be more space on the court. Instead of playing 2x45? Should we change it to 9x10 so it gets more intense? All of that won't change much. It will be something completely different. And that comes from outside, which is also the new concept we came up with. As I mentioned earlier, Red Bull is one of the companies that has found new formats. But it's one company, but they have found a lot of new formats. Some of them are humorous, and some of them are intensive, demanding sports. And then there are these formats with American Ninja, for example, which are former Jæger soldiers or elite sports people, who compete on something that is quite complex. It requires balance, timing, strength, flexibility and so on. So actually I have myself wondered if there is no more of it, because there is a lot of money and interest in finding something entertaining. It might also become more individual, so you can compete with others who dream of becoming a Jægersoldat or something like that. I think it will be decided geographically as well. I'm not sure if Denmark will be the first to move to this area. We are very united and united Denmark is built from where USA is. There is sport commercially from day one, so it's maybe where the new formats come and then we can adapt something along the way. But isn't there also esports where it's completely different? Esports is exploding right now. We have a whole program about esports. I don't want to get into that. I would like to stay with something else and that is the Danish Association of Sports. How important it is for children, for example, now I have one who plays basketball, how important it is for empathy, to be able to read others when so much time is being spent on the screen. So it's about being able to lift your gaze and see a field, and see a body language, and see a mimic, and a little tweak, and quickly figure out how this gameplay looks like. I just think it's a very basic skill. I think it should be on the school schedule, that there just has to be some sport. And I know that convenience is the easiest thing, and individualization, that goes in Gustav's direction, that it should be when it suits me and in the way that suits me. But we just have so much of the other, even though it's a bunch of other people. Hell is other people. But we just have so much of it. Could you imagine that in the future we will also have some goals in the future, that those who have practiced sport will actually do better than others. A lot of what will develop in the future is just cross-dialogues, where you have to be able to find out how to be with someone who is different from you. I think it will be a combination, because you are on a team, whether it is a swimming team, a football team or a baseball team, you can be individual. We will train more individually. Instead of 20 people training for 30 minutes three times a week, we will train for 30 minutes, but they do different things for 30 minutes. And then I think it's interesting what you say about those old people who are sitting here and reading at the same time, but it's not that many years ago that when you were old you sat on a sofa, and now it's not a six-pack that you have standing next to the sofa, it's a six-pack you have. We have theseillas, I'm not pointing at Lars, but middle aged men in Lycra, who have bodies that are 20 years old, and it's a huge investment in society that we have people who not only live longer, but live much better. What will that mean for the sport and sports of the future, that we actually get to be the same age as the day we sign? There is a lot of research that shows that for example men aged 70 and 80 who play football all their lives have stronger bones and other things. So that part of it. But I think that's where the supplement comes from, because we could actually always do sports. But the fact that we suddenly have technology that can help us, or make it more fun, or we can play it instead, then there may be more people who are on board for the car for longer periods of time, and thus gather the greatest health. You can also say that now it's just fantastic that there are so many many people can participate now. With this technology. What's the oldest you've been on the team? 70 years. I think it's amazing. What I love most about Kuntz Intelligent is that we've been given the opportunity to participate even if we may not have the means or the economy to be involved in the wave. For example, my mother, who is a pensioner, she probably doesn't have the biggest authority, but now I have taught her how she could use these artificial intelligence, where you just write and then she gets a plan. I say, mom, you just have to write like this and like that, and then you get for the mother with her arms. Then you just have to write like this and like that. Then we can focus on the nymph. And it's so easy for her. And she can't understand it at all. But how does she do it? There must be a man sitting behind. It's crazy not to understand. There are many men. And it's just so fantastic. So I think the world will only become an even better place for a lot of people. What will be the wildest changes you see? And where? You can start, but I can say... I think the wildest change will be on the experience side. Of course, performance will continue. Can we keep running stronger? Yes, we can. But I think the experience will be even greater. When we get to the stadium in 20 years, we get in these self-driving cars, and we are recognized by the faces when we get in. We sit down, the drone delivers the the hotdog and if we want one, it comes. We have data from the players performance. You could maybe be your dream player on the field in a lens while you're sitting in the stadium. It could be fun, so you run around with the players. You can choose if he should shoot with right or left. Or that the cyclist and when they drive up to the LDS, you are actually almost on the luggage rack. If you take Tour de France for example, you could be a virtual cyclist who is cycling against them, but you are sitting on your spinning bike. You could have living room. You could say that. And already today, just around the corner, we will see how many watts they instantly step on when they ride up from the AGS in Toulouse-France next year. They know that today. Now they are also starting to share it with us who are watching it. And can we then start competing with them at home in the living room on the bike? Maybe across across borders? You can put a handicap in, right? And then you can see how you can handle it. How do you handle it? How close are you? But it's integration between the physical and the virtual. I'm also convinced that it won't be long before you'll suddenlyed by your idol. I can imagine that for example Cristiano Ronaldo gets an online course and you can get Cristiano Ronaldo as your coach. But that's not Cristiano Ronaldo. It's just a robot with all his knowledge. And then you might only pay 10 dollars. But then you feel that you are actually you can send him to Ronaldo and you can't really feel the research or see the research you just know that it's not him I think that's something that's getting really big So Ronaldo is like a deep fake chatbot? I think so It is already now I I think it is becoming more obvious. And convincing. Yes, convincing. I want to hear about something else. I have tried, and it is probably in Cape Town, but I think there is something here at home, where you get these bands on your arms and legs, and then you get a flow through the ground. And then it only takes 10-20 minutes and then you have trained in what is the answer to the question. And then you have to hold a break. And on paper it sounds fantastic. We are sad people and you just have to get in. And those quick fixes, how extensive they become. If you can do this and get the rest fixed by getting some fillers in, so you get perfect sculpturing. Do we go the fast way or the hard way? I always think that we born as bad people. We always try to take the fastest way. I can see with all the sales I've made, those who sell the most, 14 days you get a lifted ass or 30 days you get a sex pass. People like that. I have a friend who has machines where you get in and it goes 180 degrees. And you get to know that you burn about 700 calories. I don't believe it myself, but it sounds fantastic. If I burn 700 calories, it takes me an hour. And if I do it in three minutes... In hell! So I think that we humans will always try to find the right solution. You think it's warm in hell, but it's cold, very cold. I really think that we can't let that be. But that's not the case with the UN. It's still and quiet, it takes time. Now there is of course also pressure on some new models, where it may not mean that it takes so much time for the individual. Much of the UN-Denmark also deals with freedom and we can see that it is harder to be a free person. I looked at who had the most success with freedom. It is a football club in West-Jutland and it is because they are very good at saying what you should do as a free person. If you have to meet at 5 pm, you have to roll 10 balls out on the court write 10 lines on Instagram about how the game went, choose a helper trainer and at 8 pm you are ready to be a volunteer. Then people say, I can figure that out, ok, then I dare to be a volunteer. But if you don't want to be a volunteer in our club club, people say. No thanks, are there no others? Because when does it start and when does it stop? How do you see the freedom and everything that needs to be stuck around these associations? Freedom is a challenge, there is no doubt about it, and it's a bit difficult, but in turn, the potential is also there. We all want to be voluntary, but we are a bit afraid to commit ourselves to being there three days a week from 15 to 17, both because we are not free from work, and it gets very tight. So if we can take those limited tasks and say, I bake cake until the evening on Saturday, I train them on Tuesday, you train them on Thursday, then there are lots of us all who really want to be voluntary. So we might have to find a new way to be voluntary, so we are maybe a little more lifting than the Torneskjøl soldiers who have driven a lot of prisoners for many years. And I could really think of Art and Intelligence says, okay, you all drive your children that way every day. Now I'm also in a election for the transport minister for the future of public transport. And I'm like, I don't dare to let my own 12-year-old daughter take public transport alone in the evening, but if now all other parents would say, now you take the train and bus to the sports places, then they could be together, so it's not that dangerous, and then we could all get off and go back and forth, which is something that is really draining. So use some intelligence to fix the group a little better, I think. Yes, but all in all, there are certainly a lot of solutions that can support the voluntary work. And it also comes from the employment side, where more and more companies are starting to say can be voluntary for two days a year, and they can choose what they want. And then you can also take a cashier opportunity in the local sports association and say that we would like to make the budget, because I am actually in the economics department here. So it may well be that there are some people coming are not very involved in the association, but who can get it through their workplace. I'm thinking a little about the integration between sports and fitness and psychological well-being. It's something I can see that has come in the last ten years. A lot of research that tells us that at one point you thought that a cure for depression is simply to get more light. You also have to think that sport is actually a good cure for depression. Instead of giving people pills, you could maybe send them to a fitness trainer, and it would be a better mood, mystically enough. I don't know if that's something you hear about, or think about in your plans for the future. When you talk about people who are depressed, and they start training, and how they change their lives. That's what I've been working with for so many years and I've experienced so many examples of people who have been on pills of happiness and been depressed. I'll give you an example. My first client, I remember his name was Magnus. He weighed 180 kg and he was almost about to die and he was so depressed. He lost 100 kg in a year, together with me. And he changed completely. He didn't need any pills. The biggest problem he had was which Tinder date he was supposed to go on. He changed completely. So the best investment is to invest in your body. I have never met anyone who has it good in their body and who doesn't get it good mentally. It affects you when you have it good in your body and feel it good. Then you automatically become very happy. I tried something in a small amount in that variant, because around 2000 I had huge problems with my back, because I ran three start-up companies in a row. And then I went to a surgical back clinic in Zurich, and they said, what you need is to do some sport, there is nothing wrong with your back, what you should do with sport. And there we have really seen a completely different approach, from inpatient to home in hospitals, where you should lie nicely still in the hospital bed, then it is just about getting people out as soon as possible and down in some form for sports center. Yes, but one thing is that we come down and do the sport, which gives us something physically, but the fact that we come down to the association and together with others, it also gives us something socially and it will support all this worry or lack of the same we have at the moment. So coming down with the comrades is just as important as getting down and getting a bike or a volleyball. When we look at 2050, is it still important that we come physically together? Yes, I think so. I can see on my app, I make a live event every week where we can train together. And they feel that they are training together. They can write with each other. They feel that they have a connection together. And I think it is important to understand that youth is also different today. Being together today is different than being together 10 years ago. We can feel that online is a way to be together. I can see that on my students. They feel together because they play computer together. And I can see that when people train together, they have a connection. We have to train on Wednesday at 7 pm and we're looking forward to it. Are you going to be with us, Birgitte? Are you going to be with Susanne? They are writing to each other. So in a way... Can you explain how it happens? It happens that I turn on my button on live and then I start training and then they see me live and then we all train live and then they can sit and write to each other. They don't talk together, they only listen to you. I've tried talking to each other before, but it's not working. So I just do it like this. That's right, and I'm sure a lot of people are happy about it. But we saw during the pandemic that we weren't able to be together as much. We had to get 10 people on the track to train, we had to go straight to the car and go home. There was a lack of social elements, where you meet in the public area afterwards and the speaker can get full pressure. That's just as much part of being in the club as being on the field. I also think a little about mental training. So I... You talk sometimes about the snowflake generation, who can't stand anything at all. They get scared, and annoyed, and all that. And then, speaking of snowflakes, because I live in Switzerland, we are very much skiing. And my children have been skiing since they were quite small. I remember once, when Sophie was 13 years old, we took her with a mountain guide on a trip that was unusually hard, where we had to walk up a mountainside and it took took a long time. It took two and a half hours to climb up the mountainside. There was heavy snow, and I was completely soaked. At one point she started to cry, she couldn't take it anymore. She couldn't go out, because there was no help. You have have to get down and we can't run with her on our backs. When we finally got down after 4-5 hours, I said we'll take her with us tomorrow. She wanted that. I have pictures of her where she is sitting and ice is falling out of her nose. It's hard. But she started two businesses when she was 18 years old. And you are trained in response. That's also something that sport can do. That's why I'm a little obsessed with that you should think sport and fitness. And this is where it's extreme, where you're pressured. You have to think about it in the normal psychological and mental health process. I work a lot with workplaces in the future, where you have to go to feedback fitness and in general. Is it something you have to think about in people your workday to make sure that all employees are getting started? I would like to start with the same uncertainty in health, where it is a small group that goes all in and trains and runs diets and follow their sports team and what Gustav says and then there are some who in short periods take some kind of slouch scheme but then it goes wrong again and for the moment there is up to 10 10 year life expectancy difference after how you live. Will it be bigger towards 2050? Or do you think there will be other technologies? Speaking of the jobs, I think it will be so normal that all jobs have fitness. I remember when I was running my company FitnessNU, I had made a fitness room for my employees. Because I knew that if they could train during the day, they would be very motivated. Sometimes it can be very hard to concentrate for hours. So it's good can get a break and train, I think it will be very normal to invest in your employees and to go up in their lives. Living healthy is healthy. And then it's not so bad. Because it's the smallest and the largest companies we have here. Of course, there are some big ones that have will have it in everyone's life every day? Or will it be just a matter of health? I'm not sure, but it's good business to have healthy employees. So I'm not in doubt that all companies will just go about training their employees to do their motions. The workplace of the future is probably also more hybrid, so there will be more time. Maybe instead of using two and a half hours in transport, we can actually use them to make ourselves healthier. So in that way, I think the gap in the future will be smaller. That was a great way to end. Thank you very much for being with us. In the years of the Formula 1 race, racing has been at the forefront of technology, innovation and engineering art. In pursuit of the microscopic competitive advantage that makes tenth of a second the difference between first and last place. And many other sports branches have begun to get inspiration from Formula 1 in the hope of optimizing precision at the same level. Cycling has, for example, taken wind tunnels to to optimize aerodynamics on both bikes and riders. Golf uses advanced simulators and radar technology to analyze everything from speed to speed of rotation and starting angle. And contact sports like football and basketball have taken a lot of sensor technologies to collect data about movements and stress and then analyze them with the help of artificial intelligence to optimize strategy and reduce damage risk. Well, Lars, we're going to the Lune round. Will this go fast or slow? In between, I would say. It's not developing as fast as artificial intelligence itself, but there are elements that will go really fast, because there is an audience that loves these things and wants to grasp all the cool things you can do with technology. For example, integration between the physical and the digital. And for example, the Personal AI that integrates with information about your DNA, that can talk to fitness machines, that ensures that there is music that adjusts to your rhythm when you do interval training and so on. We will see that for the next few years, one to two years, I think. So fast, I would say. Nice to have or need to have with all these technological layers in the world of sport? It's nice to have, but I'm a bit ambivalent, that's why I think sport and motion are so important for our society. It's a really, really big quality factor in our society. So there's a lot that points out that it is the missing piece in relation to everything from dementia to I don't know what. It's that with getting up and burning something. In fact, there is a new study that shows that sleep is not that important, but moving and getting up in pulse every day is crucial. That's number one. Maybe sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep alcohol. We've talked about that. Is it difficult or difficult to invest in? I think it's crazy that there's a new form of football that's much more showbiz. When I look at it, and you say that Formula 1, where they're in love with each other from start to finish, there's a lot of fat cats here. Isn't there a big explosion, innovation going on? Yes, there are a lot of start-up companies in the business, also in Denmark. And there are large companies, large well-established companies, that provide equipment and entertainment for this. But I can't say that the best investment is in yourself, as we heard, and investing some of your time in keeping yourself healthy and getting the joy that sport gives you, is a top-notch investment. I think if we see more of those star athletes like Beckham and Pique from Barcelona, who suddenly take their followers to other places and say, hey, let's play this. Then there is a possibility to make some huge changes in the established sports. Yes, Ronaldo as a chatbot, but also Ronaldo as a participant in other sports after he has been a professional football player. So you can follow him and he takes you into something else that is fun and that more people can be part of. Rich, healthy, sustainable or clever? Rich if you get into the right healthy, it happens to itself. And what do you say, sustainable and? Smart. Smart, certainly. You actually become more skilled in doing sports, so certainly smart and sustainable. There are fitness centers now where when you sit on the spinning bike you generate electricity. It's not super effective, but you feel like you're contributing to the party. Yes, by being strong, Lise Loll, we're just adding this to the list, the ability to be strong. So you can at least run up the stairs when you're 80, if you do sports all your life. I saw you hailing me yesterday. I did. Is it a supertrend? It's a supertrend.

So you had to be quick to survive. One thing that makes the past come to life is climate change. The ice melts and they drown in Norway and gather only one thing. So this over-ordered story of what the country is and what it comes from is just gone. Well, haven't we developed as you and Darwin? No, no. Biologically, we are the same people. Yes, 250,000 years back in time. This is Supertrends, the program where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsøe, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrends, Lars Tved when it comes to the future. The Vikings had horns in their helmets, the clothes were brown and colorless, and the women were absolutely down in the food cellar, actually after the dogs. In the face of better research and findings, we will get some huge WOW's. I had not seen that coming. We will talk about the future and to help us we have Rane Villerslev, Director at the National Museum. Hi. Hi. Lars, we'll start with you and the timeline. 1,300 papyrus rolls, completely covered by volcanic debris from 1979 due to the Vesuvius volcano. They have simply been completely you have tried to read them and every time they have become a pure coal dust. Suddenly, with the help of 3D scanning and machine learning and one of the other, you have got one of those rolls. Because 250 years ago, you said, now we don't them anymore, because they disappear from us. Then you have simply got one word out. What do you think is on that word? No, unfortunately, Lilla. But that was because we used a lot of color at that time. Our statues today are really disgusting. But actually, at that were painted in all kinds of strong colors. And that's something we've missed when we look at the eyes of the future. Yes, that's right. When you see all these statues, you can read that many of them were actually painted. I have to say that this is something that really interests me. When I was choosing my education as a youngster, historians were quite popular on my list. I have written a part about the history of my books and read a lot about it. So I'm super excited about what's going to happen here. I don't think you can understand a thing about the future if you're not interested in your past. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, who in combination with artificial intelligence, give a signal when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. That's right, and that timeline goes back in time, and I'm not talking about that much, but it goes back 3.3 million years. So we put it short for best skill or lack of it. And when I look at it from history and archeology, there are a lot of process-based innovations we have been through. Just to mention a few that I think most of you have heard about. Malsam or most of them. There are metal detectors. There are some enthusiasts who go out on on the market with metal detectors and sometimes find some very interesting things. The carbon-14 analysis method to find out how old something was, was completely psychedelic when it came out and gave us a lot of information. You can use the rond, for example, if you have a mummy or something like that, then you can find out what there is. There was this man you found in the ice in Austria, where it turned out that when you used the horn, you found pinheads inside. And then it continues towards the future, and one of the things that leads into the future I will talk about here, because I choose between a lot of things. The first time you used the self-driven laboratory, that is, the laboratory that runs by itself. It was the first prominent time in 2020, when some people at Cambridge University had a laboratory running like a robot machine and tested a lot of things. So it screened millions of different things to find a vaccine. In 2021, something came a project with the Art of Intelligence, where they found out that they could make some predictions, and that's not history or archaeology, that's confusing. Extremely cheap, fast and compact. You could make it with the same efficiency as you normally do on the super computers you typically use. So something that normally would take up to six days on a super computer could be done in a few minutes on a normal computer with the same results. In 2022, something called Generative Adversarial Networks, which is able to formulate scientific hypotheses by investigating potential scenarios for experiments. That is, you have a computer that controls an automated laboratory. The computer comes up with hypotheses, and the robots test them. They listen to what comes out, and revise their hypotheses. And then we enter the future, and we use a lot of things. We do what we call a digital twin. they have a real thing in the world, and then they make a digital replica of it, and then they use it to simulate and estimate. In 2025, we plan to have super high resolution microscopes based on artificial intelligence. And what they actually do is that they take something, they are able to register some and then look at the corresponding data and they are able to construct high resolution images on an atomic scale so you can see atoms. And then you can do this by understanding people, so now I I'm thinking about how to understand social and economic things. We start running around with some personal AI, which is a kind of digital body, a kind of digital twin of ourselves, which follows us and helps us on our phone. And information that it builds up can be given to market researchers, economists and so on. Then they can use it to find out how people react to different things. Instead of creating focus groups, you can simply download thousands of these personal AI data and then it AI data and analyze different things. Are there any people from the past you can ask questions about? There are many permutations of what you can do. We are not personal AI for people from the past, but we use a term called a backstory. A backstory is when you know a lot about the background of this model. If you know enough about the background, you are able to simulate how this digital model will react in different situations. Then there is something called literature-based discovery, which sounds like reading a book, but it is computer systems that are able to read astronomical amounts of literature. And then they find in that literature something that they otherwise would not have found. And one reason is that there is so much literature that no one can handle it anymore. So some of these models, I'm guessing 2027, will become really good at investigating something called data exhaust. That is to say, the data that comes out as a byproduct of a process. and it's not meant that the data should be used to analyze something, but people are starting to do that. For example, during Covid, they started looking for signs of Covid in chlorine water. And it was not meant, it was not anyone's idea that this would be used for measurements. But then you can see where there are covid outbreaks and you can look on Google and then you can see if people suddenly start to google on fevers or something, then you think there is probably a covid outbreak there. This can also be used on historical data and everything. But some of what will happen is that the artificial AI models that run these automated science laboratories will start to work together with different models and come up with different hypotheses. And then you have an ecosystem of hypotheses, like you have an ecosystem of animals in nature. And then AI will start to play these hypotheses against each other and see who is the best in survival of the fittest survival of the fittest model and then quantum computers come in, especially in 2031 and then it starts to go completely psychedelic fast. And then there is already a lot of work to be done today to make software that is able to understand what artificial intelligence actually looks like. Because it's often said that it's like a black box, it finds out something, but you don't know what it is. So software is written that that can decode it. It's really hard to expect that it will be called explainable AI. That it will be really effective around 2033, as it is able to see what's going on inside an AI. I would say that we can't really see what's going on inside our brains. So we have a breakdown in real life. And then there is something called meta-analyses, which is based on a whole lot of other analyses. You take maybe 100 really good scientific analyses and then you do a meta-analysis on top of it, saying what's the sum of this is. And that is something AR can be really good at. So we will probably get a lot of meta-analyses about all possible angles and all possible research in the future. And it is also around 2033, so I think it will be really big. And then the last thing I want to say is something called, there are a couple of things here, a couple of prognoses. Proactive Hypothetic Alert is that a researcher is working with something and suddenly you get an alert that tells you there is a hypothesis you may have overlooked. As I see it. And Charles Darwin imagined that before he put his theory together, he looked around with some kind of eye and then he says, Charles, have you thought about it? It can be that the species simply arise with the help of natural competition and spontaneous mutation. So that means that, and it's especially in 2040 when you expect the adoption, there will be a very strong collaboration between different art intelligence models that work in an ecosystem where they compete with each other, but where they also know each researcher's interests, because they are personal areas. And then all the time say that you should also think about it, remember that we can see it, there are others who have seen it, and so on. So it will be a whole new world, and then I will not say more. Exciting Lars, thanks for that. Researchers have long tried to extract DNA from porous substances from ancient times without destroying the DNA or the substance, but without help. Until recently. Here, molecular evolution biologists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology have succeeded in developing sequencing technique that enables them to analyze DNA remains from a yorker bone that was used as a neck ornament 20,000 years ago in southern Siberia. And thus find out that the last one that was ornamented was a younger woman who originally came from 1900 km away. According to the researchers, it opens up for totally new ways of creating historical connections by getting an insight into who has touched what at what time. I have been looking forward to welcoming you, Rane Villerslev, professor of anthropology, a professor at Cambridge and director of the National Museum. I have decided that we have two things to visualize for 2050. We will understand the future much better than we do today, but also how we will communicate the future. Because I think that's just as important. I think it's you who made the boredom button. It doesn't always go very well to bring the past to life. So I think both angles are very important to get to 2050. Lars was talking about the technology bunker, but one thing that makes the future possible is climate change. The ice melts and they are drowning up in Norway and collecting only one thing. It's crazy to think about, and maybe even learned that if we go back to the Stone Age, there were actually two degrees warmer in Denmark than there is today. It was after the ice melted and there were volcanoes. So it's not the first time we experience such radical climate change. The thing is that back then there were very few people and you could move in a different way than we do today. But we have experienced these very severe climate changes and when we come to the iron age, then there is the famous finbull winter, which is actually believed to be a volcanic eruption caused by the sun. The sun could not penetrate for several years, and And it was hit hard in our area up north where the ruins failed for two or three years with a huge solar disaster. It printed so hard in the people of the day that thevenous roc, was modelled on the Fynbul winter. Okay, so there is some truth in it. Yes, yes. Many finds actually indicate that we have been much more advanced than you might think. That is, 35,000 years ago, there were also some new hole finds, where you can scrape off with new technology. What do you find there? We have a very skilled rune specialist, who has scanned the slats on the famous Jelling stone and another stone, and found out that it is the same person who has... Oh, it's a sign, not a sign. Yes, yes. The incision, what the hell do you call it? You don't say meisled, you say something else. You say, yes, but it's at least a stone. The question is if you can say something about the person who did it. How angry he was that day. Yes, yes. You can see that he's called Rav rat, if I'm not mistaken. He who has mauled the roosters. And from different findings, it indicates that the tyrant has had a much greater impact on the... I don't remember the logic, but there is an argument for the tyrant to has had a much greater impact on Danish history than we thought. I think that's a brilliant example of how we can understand the past much better with the help of the future. We haven't been able to do that before with the myth mosquitos. No. No. But in fact, there was something I thought about here, that there is a side effect of this technology, because it is fantastic and can make us smarter and all that, but in a certain sense, there is also something about it that makes us dumber. And it became clear, we participated in a DR series called Tugted, where you had to sail over a ship over the Atlantic. It was originally a Viking ship, but it was so old that it couldn't be done. So they had to sail with a normal ship, but they had to drop the GPS. And it shows that we can't navigate today in the same could. Which is a more intuitive, a mix of facts and intuitive feelings about sea currents and all that. And we know it a bit from the GPS. I can't find my way around without a GPS. I drive completely blind after the GPS. So there is something that is hindering some senses and learning that is actually lost. That's pretty crazy Yes, and that's quite crazy, because how do you explain future generations and how to find a way if they never ever need it? No, but at the same time, the ability to orientate ourselves has been weakened extremely much. We'll get back to that when we talk about how we understand the future. Or the future in the future. Because it is clear that it is not enough to live in a Viking country town. We have to go out and try some of those skills. And transform, then it is all under control. Absolutely. Lars? I just have a remark. In stone age, at least for a period in stone age, people had 20% bigger brains than today. Yes, that's right. So you had to be quick to keep yourself alive that time. And today we have collective intelligence, so we don't need to know so much about each other. So our brains become smaller. Yes, collectively we have become smarter, as Lars says, but individually we have become dumber. And that comes with the land use, and otherwise it's accelerated. If you just do the same day in and day out, you just become dumber. While the person with a stone age should read the landscape and the weather and all that. It's quite interesting how the shy person will develop in relation to how social we are, if it's that personal AI in front of other people, if we're not dependent on other people in the same way, then it will set its own course. Absolutely. But anyway, how do you think these advanced technologies are? Lars is talking about art and intelligence, but it's also about making a mammoth again. We could clone and use stem cells and so on. Do you see that towards 2050? I want to know the future, and I am willing to use any tool available to dive into it. Do most anthropologists think so? No, I don't think so. They have a big moral overgrowth, but when it comes to recreating the mammoth, I would probably be positively invested. That's on the way. Is it? Yes, it is. Something we haven't had is a silent movie with sound. You can simply use it to read and make sound. then you just make sound. If you have so much of a noise barrier, you can actually recreate the film with sound. And that's generally what's needed. Now we heard about the papyrus wheels with Lilla. But suddenly you don't have to have a lot of elements, so the artificial intelligence is very good at filling the blanks. The challenge is that it's fiction. It's coming close, it shows our vision of reality. How far have we let it go compared to writing our books books? But I think there is a tendency to have a very naive idea of what science is. Because as a being, something that stands in opposition to fiction, and that's something I meet in criticism every time there is an exhibition or something. You disinficate. Yes, yes. But the point is that in the core, the heart of science is fiction. And if I can give you an illustrative example. If you take a linguistic diagram of Indo-European, for example, with all the languages, how they are related to each other, and how closely related they are. It's all built on facts, but it ends in something that is typically called Proto-Indo-European. I can guarantee that, there has never been anyone who has spoken about it. But it's a fiction you have to create to make a step. And in that way, one can say that fiction is present in all science as a prerequisite for actually operating it in all sorts of different ways. In archaeology, there are big holes. What we know is smaller in weight than what we don't know. And that is what you fill in with the ideas and so on, to get the theories to stick together. I have a researcher, I think his name is Mads Dengsø Jensen, who has found out that there were toned wheels in Viking houses. Why is it so hard to discover, and what does it do to our view of the Vikings, that they have lived in such cozy, toned houses? Yes, and in fact we have also discovered that their preferred drink, at least in the upper class, was red wine. No! Is the beer out? Is it a special beer? The beer is probably also drunk in large quantities, but they were foreshadowed by wine. These small elements, but important elements, are part of creating a completely different image of the Vikings. They probably looked very much like the Vikings, with make-up and pling-a-ling in their hair, and toned rudder and wine in their hands. It's both a fun thing, but also important, because it opens our minds to think the vikings a different way. When you find new Viking finds, you're not limited to a barbarian with a wolfskin around his neck and a sword in his hand. It can be something else. We have to look at that now, because it is also about understanding the future of the future. Much better than we do today. There is already a neural network today that is able to scale green historical film recordings to 4K Ultra HD with 60 frames per second. This can be done because you have trained algorithms on countless identical pairs of images where one image is intact while the other is missing, or 5-5 errors, so the machine millions of times in the end is able to fill in the missing details, even on pictures it has never seen before. And suddenly, a fascinating philosophical thought experiment arises. Because if artificial intelligence already today can reproduce reality in 4K Ultra HD based on greenish film from 1906, when will it be good enough to reproduce the past based on Can we talk about a deeper understanding? What do you see as possibility. Now we look at Lars' interactive tippet. No young people can be the king today. What's the point of not just looking at it, but sinking it and getting it into your stomach? I'm thinking about your inner compass. How do you get that inner compass? I think it's like your inner compass. So how does Søren get that inner compass? I think it's a lot about... There are many ways to do it. But one that I think is very overlooked is the ability to use the past as a kind of optics through which you look into our time. I have been meeting a lot of business leaders who talk about how they want agile management and flat structure. They hire all kinds of consultants for that. But the fact is that 80% of our time here on earth has had exactly that kind of organization. During the Stone Age, an egalitarian form of organization, the most flexible form of organization the world has ever seen, where leadership is something that pops up at the moment when you need it and falls apart when you don't need it. People only spend 20% of their time at work and 80% of their time at work to innovate and relax. That's super interesting. Yes, it's super interesting and it's also the time in our history when there is a great equality between men and women. Women can shoot bears and men can also be sick and so on. So it's a free energy to relax. Yes, they completely wild. So they are lying on the savannah like a lion or what? Yes, but the crazy thing is, I have also been with them in Siberia, so I have been with them on my own body, but also if you take buskmen and hattas in Africa, which are known as the most egalitarian, the crazy thing is that they live in the most barren environments and still only uses 20% of their working hours. How it would have been if we lived in Europe, where the climate was much more comfortable to operate in. And there are no strange squabbles that work all the time. Yes, and the crazy thing is that very few actually work a lot and the majority of them are just lazy. And that's not a problem. That's interesting. My point is that if you use the collectors as an optics, where you look into your organization and say, how would my organization look like if I used these principles to organize with. Of course you can't make a one-to-one translation, that would be crazy to believe, but you can make a creative translation where you take the principles and turn them in and see what happens. Then you can save a lot of consultant help. You mean that you can get more women to take over, for example? You could do that, but you can say that the fun thing is that startups have someups have this kind of approach. The big problem is how you scale it up. Here we are talking about groups of 50, which now have to scale up to 730. But the principle of doing these transitions from the past, you could also do it with feudalism or something else. I don't think you get a system you can live in. Some kind of. Exactly. But the way to use history, where you actively translate it into our own time as a force, as a force of change, I think that's outstanding. Another thing I could think of was to get them involved in, when history is so changing, how changing our future is, that you get a big wave of opportunity, that your space of opportunity is much larger than you thought you had by visiting different situations. Absolutely. And that's where ethnography and anthropology are important, because it's a footnote science in the big picture, but it has the very important function of pointing out that the human being is more than the old Greeks, which is always referred back to when we talk about the archaic human being. The gap is enormous. And that creativity and diversity in experiments, human experiments and organisational experiments, we should be much more interested in than we are, I think. I don't understand why we're talking about screen time, like we've had with the gamers, who have screen guilt. They don't dare to tell the adults what they are doing. And I think that's super interesting, that we actually have a story right now that is being written by a group of people that we can't see, that we don't know. So how do you think that your role as both anthropologists, researchers, historians is are in relation to going out to other places in society? In 2050, are you also a place you visit at the National Museum? Or could you imagine that you penetrate many different areas of society because you naturally start to think? I would really like to have both parts. I am working on a renovation of the National Museum. It is very expensive. I am working on it. Just make it as a hologram. Yes, exactly. You need a physical place. You will also come. But when that's said, I would like the ideal world, the National Museum or the science that's there, to be part of a daily life, part of an inspiration in the day-to-day. I think that before you paint the wall who are interested in history now than in the 90's. There is a huge market and the world of museums is in progress. There are more people visiting museums than ever before. I think it's crazy that these Viking-citizens have been found. You can't see them with your naked eye, and they are all up and running, but now they sell all kinds of Viking stuff, based on their satellite observations. It's more that it's the same historical periods that we don't practice all the time. The Vikings for example. In the Bronze Age, there were no experts and few people interested in it. But it's the period that is the richest period for us. That's where we have the biggest finds. But the Vikings... Is it because the crazy researchers have won the things and haven't been able to convey it? Or do we need more artificial intelligence that can travel through time? Yes, that could be good. What would be a time- to get back to if I gave you a time-miss? I'm crazy about the Stone Age, so I would like to remember when the Las Cominas were painted down in France and the other holes in Spain. I think that would be fantastic. was shortly after the Homo sapiens started to travel into Europe, that they started painting. And they were so sophisticated, when Picasso saw them, when they were finally discovered by chance. No one believed that it was the stone age people who made them, but that's what they found out. And then Picasso said, we have learned nothing. Because it was so fantastic. But if you say that most of our time today, we don't know it. We can have a little bit. How much do you think we are short-lived towards 2050 2050? If you were to give some percentages, how much more can we see? Thanks to machine learning, thanks to gene sequencing, thanks to these new technologies. I think we should be aware of some different things here, because I think we know a lot more. In principle. Not because of DNA and and other natural methods. But what I'm more afraid of is, do we know more about how they actually thought, how they actually were? Because in these evolutionary models, which often are based on that kind of research, there is some kind of resource maximization and so on. But biologically they were identical to us. Identical. If you took a 40.000 year old baby and put it in here and re-created it, it would be a child in the same way as our children. Well, haven't we developed as we did before? No, no. Biologically we are the same people. 250,000 years back in time. But the point is that when we start to analyze them scientifically, and the longer we get back in time, the more we make them into animals, machines. But there is no doubt that they have had all sorts of kebab-ing, sexual perversities and whatever else follows, which we also have today. And there is a tendency to, even though we know more and more, we simplify more and more who these people really were. And that is of course also because, how can we, how is it possible to get access to their heads? It's that complexity. Yes, it is. But that's why, if we can get back to him, the runemaker, and maybe start reading his intentions through his stone, his recognition of the coin and joy, then we also start to get some more lively portraits of these people. I think women are historically important in many ways, because there are probably not many stories about them when you look back. No. But something that is really interesting about people is memes. The mindset we have, which we bring forward through hundreds or thousands of years. At one point I read a book based on genetic analysis of the British population. And then I found out that the people on the Orkney Islands, which I heard were very small, they came primarily from Norway. And then in England they came primarily from primarily Anglesaxers, and the rest, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, they were also Celts. And the Celts actually came from Basque Country, where they had gone up that time, the water level was 130 meters lower. But then you go on and find out that around 1604, when the British began to populate Northern Europe, they took all the Celts to the southern states and the Anglesaxes to the northern states. And then they start a civil war again, which is just a recap of what I've had a hundred times before. And that's interesting. Okay, so we know where they come from, and we also know that the Arangensaxes were dominated, because you can see on the eukomotor, where the men come from, and on the mitochondria, where the women come from, and then you can actually see that there was a weight gain. What you could read from that was that the Arangensaxes had killed many Celtic men and then taken their women. What a surprise! But then you know that they have different values. You saw that in the Southern states and the Northern states. These values are very far back time, and that's where my question comes in. If you research in memes, and sociology and psychology, but especially sociology is about the memes we have now. We have to find a way to find out how the memes of the hermits and the angels were created. And when you think of memes, you also think of values. Yes, values. For example, I think Adam Smith was right. Everyone wants to have the respect of others, but in different societies, different things are required to be cared for by others. So this is something we can use the present to understand the present. Yes, exactly. It is a big question, but anthropologically, is a lot of research into values. One of the most famous examples is from the 60's. It was a French structuralist, not very modern, but called Dumont, who compared Indian values with European values. And as he said, in the beginning, the Indian hierarchies, the archaists, we equalize. But then he said, but if we now look at, speaking of what I was talking about with the Stone Age earlier, if we now look at India, for example, through a western perspective, then we will discover that behind these official values and castes, there are some shadow values that are egalitarian, but that have been marginalized in some places where they are not problematic for the society. And in the same way in the west, if you look into the West, you will see that the otherwise egalitarian society in the West, there are lots of hierarchies, among other things in the family between man and woman, this was back in the 60's, so it was much stronger and such. And what is interesting about that exercise is that these shadow values that each society has, they are like a potential subverter of the dominant values. They have the potential to make a revolution and take over. So if you want to understand a society, you need to understand the official values, but also the shadow values, and you need to understand the interaction between them. That's what we call trends and against trends. Yes, that's it. And that's what's incredibly difficult historically, because if you look at the Rune Stone, it's the official story that is told. The question is about 2050, and we get those against trends, because we can see more nuances and read between the lines. It's a combination of more things. There's a combination of us actually learning new things, and so on. But then there's also a combination of the research that is extremely colored by the time we live in. Feminism, for example, which has received a revival here, does, and it's not a criticism, but it makes you see the women of the past in a different way. And that's what it's actually been needed for, you could say. But it's shaped by what is it that dominates here now, which then becomes the subject. And when we ask about that, Arne, then I think that something we see with the news is that it has become very fragmented. Does our historical image also become very fragmented? It is already. There is one who can eat the first world war, there is one who can stone people. It is extremely fragmented today. But we don't really have any common language or sense of unity. No, you have to say that. It is enormous, and I actually consider it a kind of threat to the cohesion of our society. I was looking back at how many buildings there have been since 1850. And there has been one in every generation. But when I looked at the contents of all the buildings, like they were confusing each other. I thought, what the hell? Have they been totally uncreative? No. It's because the concept of education, until the internet came, has been so insanely stable. As a student, you read about the gold horns in school, you came in and saw that the original was deeply engraved and went out again. Today people think that the gold horns are trumpets, the Vikings led the Stone Age. And that's not an expression of them becoming dumber, it's very important to underline. It's just an expression of that they have specialized themselves completely, this over-ordered narrative of what the country is and what it comes from is just gone. And then you can say, we don't care. I think that personally, and I'm not really a nationalist, but I still have it like this. There are only the stories we have about ourselves. And there are quite a few institutions that carry them. Like Kongehus, DR, and Christiansborg, and the National Museum. Quite a few. If they are not well functioning, then you have the fragmentation and polarisation under the surface. And that is directly a threat to our democracy. Yes, that is what you can say. At least our thoughts about a Danish society. I can't help but think about something else. We see a fantastic digitalization. I'm also in a niche in the European Commission, which is for cyber attacks. I can't help but think that we live in a pretty tough geopolitical situation. And if there are people who press the shut down button, and you you're in it yourself, we don't know what's east, north and south. But can we actually become history-free if someone pulls the trigger? Yes. It's just as bad if someone pulls the trigger and we lose all the data. It would be just as bad would be even worse than the Brazilian National Museum, which burned down here a few years ago, where they lost 95% of their cultural heritage. I just heard a book about the history of the libraries. Earlier, when Genghis Khan came to attack a state in the Middle East, the wise librarians, or whatever you call them, they memorized a book in their heads. And then the library was burned down, and they tried to survive. And those who survived wrote the book down again. They had memorized it, but we're not able to do that anymore. We can't even memorize a page anymore. But I can't help but think about building up and time. It's up and running. We're just making a digital version. We're making it as a hologram and we don't need to own it. And in return we can transmit it all over the world, because we can run virtual history concerts. We are already investigating whether we can put it on a blockchain with the NFTs. On the currency area. The currency is a huge collector object. The biggest after-sales. And there are some people like no one else. We private people would people, would never be able to find them, but they could maybe be found through a digital copy. But it takes a long time to get the lawyers in the Ministry of Culture to find out if we can do it. And then I can imagine thinking about education, education, all, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, education, own avatar and you can... Yes, exactly. The way you can put it down in the air. But we are in full swing, you could say. We are so much in the process of starting to think about whether we should stop and do something else. We have for example Avatar and the Egg White Girl, which you can talk about. We have used all the gamification in the Viking exhibition, which is now. Kasper Holten is going to do a big exhibition about Vikings, where he uses all the drama. But of course we also need to taste and feel. We have done research on the museum's children's experiences and maybe not surprisingly, it is actually wanted to touch, taste, smell. I mean, extremely basic. The challenge is that some museum objects, the originals, you just can't touch. But then you can do... I mean, stairs are a super old-fashioned... Are we out in 3D and just making a lot of stairs in a farm? Yes, I think the future will be a combination of those two things. You can say the virtual and the immersive museum room, as you might call it, where you enter a digital world and now I'm in the iron man and you see the winter of Fynbulus and so on. It should also be combined with something tactile and something smelly. Because we have done something like this with mental illness and trauma and something they take advantage of is the smell to get people back in other times. If you've been in a crisis, you can smell organic stuff. And I think that could be very useful. I don't know how you can use future technologies to create that smell. But the smell of the quackers in Copenhagen must have been something. We do it in Christiansborg. There are no kitchens. It's in the kitchen. But it should be some pleasant food. Not the smell of cloacas. We use it, but we have to do it in a much greater degree. But it will be a mix. My point is that there won't be one way. It will be a mix of old school, where you can climb out and move things, while being thrown into total universes. And certainly also with some gamification. I must admit that I personally have become more interested in exploring other ways, but we probably shouldn't experiment with that at the National Museum, because there is no way to do that. But I think, for example, Soviet montage art from the 1920s is extremely interesting, because it doesn't have any narrative. Like Vertov, Man and the Movie Camera, all that crazy soviet montage art from the 20's. They just bounce up the buildings and boom boom boom. And there is no narrative. And it has disappeared completely, but it is a way to experience it. That you can make your own history. Yes, and it's actually combined with poems they wrote. Like, I'm a tank, I can shoot, I'm half machine. It's really cool. But it's something that's completely dead. But in reality, that type of art form is more suited to a museum than the American narrative. Now I'm taking you on a journey. You have to be a character. But no one really experimented with it. So our early years in 2050, how new have we got our eyes on and what has surprised us the most? I have a message, because I think with generative AI, you are able to recreate really good representations of how the world was at different times. That means, for example, if you take Europe... I also have an idea now! If you take all the knowledge we have about city's interior, architecture, how people lived and all kinds of things, it's insanely much knowledge, then it can render Europe. We would like to see Europe in 1290. Then you can move around and put in avatars that are completely lifelike and give them a realistic backstory from what you know about how they lived. They move around and live their lives and then you can move in that world. And that's a supplement to yours, Lars, because it's Google Maps, where you can just say minus 1200 years. So you can go back and forth in the calendar, so Google Maps suddenly becomes a historical site. Yes, exactly. And then I would like you, Ragnhild, to talk about gambling, because gambling is just a huge thing. Yes, it was very funny. It was just an experiment. Me and three other researchers from the National Museum, we decided to look at human history from an early age, and then we actually stop at the point where the earthquake occurs, but it's also a very long period, 80% of our time is on earth. If we look at it through a game, there are things that will look different. And what suddenly became clear to us is that the gambling has been the driving force in innovation. In everything from the creation of the bow to casting the dice, to how you organize yourself, etc. And that might seem strange to people, why is that so interesting? But it is because most of the analyses have been rational. They should have something to eat and then they had to invent this to shoot animals. And what is also interesting is that in the face of the factconditioning and move towards modern times, there will be less and less room for play. And play is prepared in a few areas of children's lives. We know that from our own children. In the free quarters they have to play, but in school they have to learn something. You can tell us about that. It should lead to our innovation power falling. If we don't play. The less we play, the less innovation power there is. We have to innovate. That's why I wanted to have it forward-looking. Because the third part of the jobs, Lars and I are talking about, disappears, or the content disappears. And then it's about playing to create new value and meaning as people and not as machines. And even something like humor, if you look at what humor is, and we tend to think that's something where people have it funny, and we don't have to take it seriously, but it's just entertainment. But humor is a very good example, because when you make a joke, you actually put two things together that don't logically go together. And then there's an absurdity, and then you learn. And in learning, your eyes are transported to a new place. And you look at the condition of the humor from a new angle. And that's why satire drawings are so important for democracy. It's that they reveal, like the humor reveals, that you learn to see the object from a new angle, which may not be true in a history book-like sense, but still has an element of truth. So, if you draw Anders Fogh as a hooligan, or whatever it is, you show something that is not evidence, but which in some way tells the truth. And that kind of play, where the gaze is driven to a narrow place, is the prerequisite for innovation. Innovation lies in the narrow gaze, and not common sense. So play with history towards 2050. That is very important. If we want to be on the world stage, and in practice have it better as humans, then it's a really good idea to put some time into it. It's really cool to have you with us. Thank you. Thank you. The laboratories of the future will be much more self-driving than it has been possible before, with artificial intelligence and robots that in unnoticed interaction formulate hypotheses, perform experiments and to the Lune Roundup. It's a huge subject, both in the way we talk about history and the way we understand our history. It's very exciting to look that way. Yes, for me, there is nothing more dangerous than a history-free person. I think it's really important for society that we have a deep understanding of our own history and the world's history. It requires, first of all, that we are able to, with the help of science and the knifes, to uncover the history, but of course also to convey it, which is a completely different task. So it's a need to have? It's a need to have, yes. I couldn't quite get out of my head if this is going to go very quickly, because we think we get so many breakthroughs, or if we are actually losing something. We talked a little about not being able to find a way, that we can't find East and West anymore. How quickly will this come to a 2050? I don't think it's such an explosive thing, but the technologies I talked about from the timeline at the beginning, it was something about artificial intelligence that finds different hypotheses and that part of it I think can come to go very quickly. For example, you also do something called World Value Survey every four years, a gigantic sociological and value-based research. If you now compare it with what we know from DNA research, where people come from, then suddenly you start to be able to put data together from different disciplines and then understand our values and our history much better. And then you can also understand our conflicts better and so on. And that kind of thing, there are more and more possibilities. Like that, that you can render the world in some random time in the world in the past. And then you can come into it, you can make computer games where people are in that world. And the more time you spend in this prehistoric time, the better you will understand it all. I'm thinking about whether it will be so good that you just want to stay in the Stone Age. Of course with the medicines we have found today. But if they only worked 20% and played the rest of the time, it sounds very cool. Yes, I think you get a cold in your head at some point, but then you start eating a marshmallow and then you start again. Yes, that's it. Then I have to press restart. When do we become rich, sustainable, smart or lazy? We become smart and lazy. And that is very important. And now we also have to listen to Rane, who is writing money for the renovation. Is it smart to invest in this? I think it is completely central to invest in. So we click on Supertrends. Thank you for listening to this episode of Supertrends.

The problem is that super stimuli lead to overexploitation. And if you can't regulate your overexploitation and the natural mechanisms that the body has to try to keep itself healthy, then you get these problems. But can we imagine in 2050, when it will be so attractive with these stimuli, that we simply can't keep the real goods out anymore? This is Supertrends, the program where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrends, she is more sure of having chosen the right one and is more satisfied than if she gets 24 men served on a plate. It's about how we with more and more possibilities, paradoxically enough, can become more and more bored of it and harder to satisfy. The buffet challenge, as it's called, is just one of the many super stimuli that is in society and that's what this episode is about small fish in a very big bucket or a very big and strong fish in a tiny bucket? If I'm a shark, I'd probably like to be the big one in the small bucket. But if I'm otherwise little Lars, I would rather be the little one in the big wave, because then there are many places I can swim to. But it's actually the opposite. If you are in a small wave, you will feel like a big shark. Even if you are not, I think it should be understood. And if are in a very big boat, you will feel a little bit and relatively you will feel inferior and bad compared to the others. But I'm completely on it, because you live in Switzerland and you are rich, but you are not very rich. So you have chosen to be a small fish in a big bucket. Now I would like to get into all this with habits and what is it that creates stimuli? What makes us happy? We think we want one thing and then it might be something completely different. Because that with luck is an incredibly stupid thing. If you are kissed in the same way when you come home from work by your husband every day, then it won't take more than a couple of weeks, then you won't notice it. There is a word for it. It's called the hedonistic third mill. So avoid the hedonistic third mill. For God's sake, let's switch sides daily and kiss each other in different places on the body. Lars, what is it about stimuli and flow? Can you explain a little more about it? Yes, it's something I'm very interested in. It's something that falls under positive psychology, which is psychology for ordinary people or about ordinary people. And I read at one point, and have written about it in a book, something called Flow. I've actually written about it in several books. But there is a researcher called Csikszentmihalyi and he introduced the term Flow to psychology, so it became a thing. And Flow is where you do something that is quite difficult and demanding, but when you master it, you get a feeling of being a little high. In any case, it feels really good and you forget some time and space, maybe, if you have a really big flow. And of course, you can get a completely wild flow when you do extreme sports or something like that. But there are also small flow experiences in everyday life. And then at some point he makes an experiment where he calls a number of people in and explains to them what flow is and then asks them to write down when in their everyday life they have small or big flow experiences. They are so happy. After which he tells them that now the experiment should be done, they must not do any of those things. It goes completely wrong. Already after one day, then there starts to be something with that they can not sleep, some of them have a headache, they are stressed, they become depressed and so on. And after two days the breeder is too sweet. And I think that's why when you look at stress, it's often not that people are tired, but that they just can't do what they think is exciting, and that they don't even have control over what they should do. Yes, loss of control is a very big thing, but they have researched a lot, where does the flow come from, and It can come from what we call the eudaimonic part of our lives, which is a technical term, but it means when you work with something where you feel you have a goal, bring your children up, create a project or something like that. Or the hedonistic part, which is what looks good on Instagram. I'll give you some examples of what gives people flow. It can be anything from food, especially sweet food, to music and laughter. And then there's love and sex, it's condi training, and hair sport and extreme sports, sunlight, meditation, everything with touch, from women who are cuddling to hugging, kissing on the chin, friends, the cage with their caged animals and so on. So when you have these experiences, it solves it in different ways. Some enzymes, dopamine, serotonin, endomorphine and oxytocin, which makes you feel good. If you don't get it in your everyday life, you will get sick. Some people also love adrenaline. They have adrenaline junkies. They a junkie with something the body itself distinguishes. Where researchers say that about half of the world's population can like to get an adrenaline shock with the big roller coaster. About 30% don't like it, and 20% are a little in between. Is it something you can learn? We have to ask our guests. Yes, we have to ask our guests. And then there are also some who really like testosterone. I remember one, I saw a movie with him who lifted a half ton in a deadlift for the first time. And he, there is a decidedly blue out of his nose, which I personally think looks really cool, but others think it's ugly. And his pulse is rising above 200. But there is a lot of testosterone in it, and some of us get a real high from it. Others probably don't. What we're going to talk about today is that we need all these small injections of something that gives us energy and joy. But the problem is where do you get it from? From something that is good for you or something that is bad for you? The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built built by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives a signal when future groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. There are a lot of technologies that we can see in the Supertrance machine that have something to do with how we get these joy experiences, how we control it and how we control it when we do it in the wrong way. So the first thing is that there are those personal AI, personal artificial intelligence, which guides you through life. It is something that is on its way to full speed and you expect to get someone who is psychologically supportive by the end of next year, especially in 2025. That means that they can psychologically and emotionally guide you through life and help you not to go the wrong way, but try to get these joy hormones and so on. Then we also have in 2025 that these personal AI can help you to get personal growth, as they say. Now I'm not thinking about your stomach that should grow, but that you become a bigger person, that you become more capable of managing challenges yourself, and so on. They can also be your mentor, who helps you get the right knowledge and education. So, speaking of what can run on an app, we have dating apps, lots of them, it's a huge success. And a very big part of all couples in the world today started with dating apps. But if we have personal AI that knows a lot about us, then you can imagine that these dating apps date with each other. It's a bit like in some countries where it's the parents who make arranged marriages. Then we can imagine that our dating apps make arranged marriages, so algorithmically. And then there is also a prognosis for that these dating apps can actually quantify love. Because there are some bio-indicators for being in love. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. Now I'm just saying what you expect to happen. So if you have something that says you are 70% in love right now. That would be very funny to see. And if your partner is 10% in love, then there is probably a problem. Then we come out of what is a bit juicy, because the brain-computer interface is on its way. And then there may be many who think of Elon Musk's Neuralink, where you, to can say a little brutally cut a hole in your head and stick a chip in. And if you run the Dan card through a store many times, you get a little blow in the brain. Yes, like a distraught and stick a Dan card in the brain and what not. Oh yes, there is no Dan card. If you go out through a store and think you want to buy it, you get a discount. I think that the invasive brain-computer interface is very marginal. But what may become quite big is that you can already put pallet on your head and then the pallet can either read out what is happening in a part of the brain, that is, what is active now when you do this, but it can also make it a little harder, but it can also stimulate a part. And then you have to listen to the programs that are about mental health and what is about reading thoughts. That's right, but I'd like to talk about egotism. I'd like to too. So there's a prognosis that you can get an experience by wearing a turtleneck and stimulating it. That part of the brain is involved in that. Then there's something called Synthesia, and I wasn't aware of it until a relatively short time ago. And that was because someone wanted to interview me. He said that if I told him what I thought about some pictures and some music, he could tell me how much of a wine I liked. So I got checked Synthesia. There is actually a whole of syntesis in the supertrans machine. So it's when one sense affects the other. For example, there are some people who have it as a disease, where if they hear a special sound, they see a color. The other day I was talking to a Spanish woman who is the director of a quantum computer company in Cambridge. I told her about it. She said, I have it. So she has it. When she hears special things, she sees some colors. But you can also use it for something. You work on finding out if this can make it easier for you to, for example, remember some things. So it will be worked on both on apps to use it constructively and also to do something about it if it is a problem. What we can see with people with trauma is that if you find the smells or sounds, they are completely back in the crisis situation and you can stimulate them much better to treat these traumas. Yes, so it's actually a very large area this. But in 2032, a fifth of the OECD population will have closer relations to their artificial intelligence software than they have with any human. In 2032, it is estimated that genotherapy can be used to help with certain special types of problems. And last but not least, in 2040, we might be able to make artificial organs that can help with... Look, there's an extra eye, an extra ear. Yes, that can help with certain problems such as extreme overweight or diabetes. And that you can use these brain-computer interfaces to cure ludomania, narcomania and various other diseases. Niklas Brindborg, welcome. Thank you! You are originally a candidate in biotechnology, you have written some incredibly good books, Gobbler Ellis, Backland, which has become a giant bestseller, and now Vanedyr, which is in a great way about super stimuli. So you are also employed at the Rigs Hospital with some PhD. Is there any pressure? Can you give us an update? Yes, I am a PhD student at the Rigs Hospital at the Trygfonden Center for Active Health. And what are you looking at there? I am researching in the elderly, so it is actually what I write about in Gobler, in Gobler and Ellis-Baglands. Unfortunately I don't deal with it all, but it's research into what happens when we're in Ellis and of course what we can do about it. And how do you define the super stimuli? I think the easiest way to understand it is with an example. This research, where the phenomenon was named at the beginning, was typically made on birds. And birds are attracted to their own eggs, because they have to call on these eggs to carry their genes and so on. But it turns out that you can actually get them to predict false eggs over their own eggs by overdoing some of the things they naturally have attached to. So you can make eggs from plaster that is three times larger than normal, but otherwise it looks like a normal egg, and then they would rather lie on the big eggs. You can also take some of the bird species that lie in different colors of eggs and then overdo the color with some paint. And then they will also rather lay on these pang-colored eggs than their own, a little matte egg. So in reality, a super stimulus or super normal stimulus, as it is also called, is that we identify what we are attracted to by one or the other thing. Then we in a way that nature could never have been involved in. But we don't typically have rules that say that we are attracted to an egg that has a specific size. There is typically just a rule that says the bigger the better, or the stronger the color the better the better. So when we get our technology in, we can make art-based publications that we can never compete with. What you also use this egg for is the big metaphor for the society we are in right now. You talk about these technologies. Try to mention some of the areas where you see extreme levels of super stimuli. So we can get the listeners with us, because they are sitting and nodding their heads at this bird and think it is evil. But we are in the same degree evil. So you have identified what are some things about food that people like. We are among other things attracted to sweet taste. We are also attracted to fat content in our food, because fat is a very concentrated form of calories, which is really good if you are hungry, but of course not so good when you live in a society like ours, where there is a lot of food. So you have identified some of these things, then you combine it them and give it all at once in a really concentrated calorie form, which is also really sweet and of course has a lot of different artificial flavoring that then has to strengthen this experience. So there is no natural food that can compete with a Mars bar in any way. And of course that's why it tastes so good, that's why we want to eat it. And then the problem is that it gives an unnatural amount of calories compared to its size. So it's pretty easy to eat too many calories. And then we can end up eating too many calories and become overweight. And that's what we see all around the world. And it's not just about processed food that we see this. We also see a narco epidemic. If we look at something like cocaine, it has had some pretty intense consequences lately. Can you also mention them? Well, you could say that when we talk about different forms of substances, they typically work by, instead of stimulating the brain through the senses, you go directly into doing it chemically. So you take a substance that goes up in the brain and activates some of the parts of the brain that have a feeling of happiness or well-being in general. I would also like to talk about women's addiction, which is more pronounced when they are in 9th grade than boys. And do you think that has something to do with this super stimulus? Does it have something to do with the bubble I was talking about at the beginning, whether you are a small fish or a big fish? Yes. We can see that there is quite of evidence that it has something to do with social media. Social media is an example of how effective such large companies can be to achieve their goals. Their goal is to keep you engaged on their social media, because the longer you sit there, the more advertisements you can see, the more money they earn. And this has shown that they are really, really, really good at this. So within the last year and ten, we have been using an hour every day, at least a part of the population, on social media. So you enter an alternative reality where you live digitally and there are other rules. But as they optimize their products to be there as long as possible, you have to deal with some of the things that we humans like to look at. And some of the things we like to look at are among other things attractive people, successful people we like to listen to and see. So this digital world is dominated by those who are the most successful within different entities, which could be outstanding, commercial success, most talented in music, etc. The problem is that we are developed in a society where 150 people, or 150 people, maybe up to 400 people, is the discussion. But at least a society where you are surrounded by relatively normal people. So if you try to define your own traits in relation to them, then there will be something you are better at, something you might not be as good at, but you will realistically have some things that you can build your self-esteem on. When you then enter this digital world, which is dominated by not only top 1%, but top 0.001%, then they become the 150-400 people we see every day. And then it is clear that if you compare your appearance with someone who is not ordinary beautiful, then you will judge your own appearance as bad. And one of the things we can see is that if you look at people who suffer from anxiety and depression, they have a lot of what is called up-and-coming comparisons with themselves. So they compare themselves a lot with people who are better off. And it has never been easier than now, because we have access to this false reality, which is dominated by people who are completely abnormal, but who will become normal. And we could stay here in the present and talk about all these super stimuli, but I have three scenarios for 2050 that we must have researched. If you have a feeling of being overstimulated, that it all seems bigger, stronger, faster and wilder today than earlier in life, then you should know that you are not alone in it and that your experience of good and evil is right. We live in an all-time-on culture where social media, news channels and notifications are capped about our attention in a daydream. Film and series and cartoons are becoming more and more action-packed. Homemade food is becoming ultra-finished. The homemade food is using a food processor, an air fryer and a sous vide. The weather is becoming more and more extreme and the depth of virtual reality is getting deeper and deeper. The fashion is not only changing four times a year, but is now based on 52 micro-seasons. Technological devices are getting more and more functions, electronic music Now we are going to three different scenarios against 2050. We ask you to listen. It's interesting and exciting. It goes all in. But in one scenario, it will be the big companies, the big tech giants, the researchers, the criminals, who will win the battle. So in a way, ladies and gentlemen, it will get worse and worse. We will get machine learning for this time, which will create universes. If anyone has seen Ready Player One, then it's about a future where everyone is online all the time because it's so exciting and stimulating that they don't want to be alone in their own lives. They're sucked into these online universes. They can be any avatar. They can look fantastic, they get superpowers, they ride roller coasters, and everything is fantastic. And then you flip over to a dystopian grey reality where people are sitting and all crushed in their gamers chairs. And of course, that's an old-fashioned picture of a dystopian future. But can we imagine in 2050, when it will be so attractive with these stimuli, that we simply can't keep the real thing out anymore. Do you think that this is what Lars is talking about in the beginning? That we end up presenting a personal AI that sees life? I would say that there are people who already live like that today. It's not a large part of the population at this point in time, but there is a part of the population who spends more than half of their living time digitally, who of course also suffer from overweight, some of the same people, because they are not physically active, but also because they probably consume a relatively large amount of ultra-financed food. Maybe not delivered. So yes, it's not normal at the moment, but you can already see it today. And what about dating? Lars was talking about something like love and egotism that can be stimulated. We already have some apps where you can swipe and swipe. I was a little bit into the idea that you get more upset if you have 24 men to choose between compared to six. What is it that happens in 2050? What is your super stimulus? Where does it take our relationships? I can imagine that you get these artificial lovers based on artificial intelligence, where you don't have contact with a real person, because artificial intelligence can be optimized to be more attractive to you than a physical person could be. At least if we're talking about being an entertaining conversation partner, being supportive at different times, also in terms of appearance, if we imagine different forms, where it becomes more that you feel that you are in a real universe when you are digitally than when you are sitting in front of a screen, then it would be impossible for a biological person to get up with the optimization you can make digitally. So what you're saying now, makes me think that we're not living in a simulation like Elon Musk thinks? Well, that's an argument that is a bit up in this. It will be possible to create a very realistic simulation that can out-conquer what we call physical reality. But these competitors, these huge mastodons, they are blowing up. Can bodybuilders keep growing? Can we keep using them for longer? There are limits. How much can this pump up to 2050? Have we only seen the beginning? First of all, we have the hedonic third wheel, as Lars talked about. Based on a principle called desensibilization. Which is based on that when we experience something that is nice, we have to get used to it. And then it becomes the new baseline. Then we have to take a step over it to get this feeling again, until we have done it enough times that we get used to it. In Vanity, I describe, for example, jumping into a fall screen with someone who has jumped 10,000 times and who has completely lost the rush that comes with jumping into a fall screen. And you can see that sometimes with some of those who have done extreme sports, that it is not enough to be with some kind of extreme sport. It should be more and more extreme. We also see it with substance abuse, and that is also why, as we talked about earlier, with cannabis, it is also why stronger and stronger products are issued, because you calmly turn to it. So if you want the same stimulation, you have to go higher and higher. That fentanyl is crazy. They had written that there were a lot of deaths in New York because of fentanyl, and then it was mixed with substance abuse, and that they also wanted to have that strong substance. I don't think they will be afraid when they read it, but it was simply a picture of how dependent they are. It comes from opium in its time. So first you had opium, then you invent morphine, which is ten times stronger than opium. Then you invent heroin, which is twice as strong as morphine. And then you find fentanyl, which can be up to 100 times as strong as heroin. So it's just an escalation all the way up. And you also inevitably, unless you're a person who has never taken drugs, and you start with fentanyl, have a pretty big chance or that it will go completely wrong. But you have this desensitization in the course of your both of the misuse, but also with normal experiences, which then makes you constantly whine after something stronger and stronger, but the consequences are not necessarily less. So if it is for example with food, then you can start with vanilla ice cream, then there is chocolate sauce on top, then there is chocolate chips on top, and finally you are at Ben & Jerry's, where you get enormous amounts of calories and sugar. Oh, my mouth is running in water. We are very far from the little bit of oxytocin that is released when you nullify your dogs. So you are constantly taking the step up and then of course there are some who have more to the left. And that is what the school teachers are talking about. The students can not keep focus in a normal teaching class anymore. Who has the problem? Are it the super-stimulated children who come home, or are it the boring teachers? Yes, one can say that our brains are built to search for the greatest reward we can find at any given time. So the greater the rewards we fight for when we have to to do now in scenario number two. We live in a time with an overflow of information streams and technologies that are designed to drive a rush on our attention. You can easily be overwhelmed both cognitively and and sensory. As a reaction to this overstimulation, there has been widespread interest in offers that do the opposite by creating sensory free space. This can be so-called silent retreats, which are a form of vacation where you withdraw to be with others in silence. Or the more technological floatation thoughts, where you float in a dark and sound-isolated capsule, designed to create an experience of senseless weightlessness. Because the other thing we can do against 2050 is to do it deadly. A bit like moving to an island and there is nothing. So if you have been far away in the country for a while, then it suddenly becomes exotic, for example, to find a restaurant that that serves a little bit of good food. So you tell your book about a potato farm. Not that it's lazy to eat potatoes, but what's so fantastic about potatoes? Potatoes are the most nutritious food we know. So if you eat a lot of potatoes, you need fewer calories before you get full. I'll describe it in more detail. But one of the reasons is psychological. If we're not talking about chips and french fries but if we are talking about a cooked potato without any condiments, then it is the opposite of the Mars children. Something that does not stimulate you mentally while you eat it. Therefore, you will also be full earlier, because there is a physical component of fullness, but there is also a psychological component. And where else can you do this? You mention salt, which is a good thing to remove, for example, in a period. This scenario is a cold-circus scenario, that we simply have to get rid of the entire population. So Denmark decides to increase the super stimuli wave and to have our natural senses back. Where do we have to put this? It doesn't have to be as sad as it sounds. We talked about desensibilization, where you lose your sensitivity, but there is also what is called re-sensibilization, where you return to the sensitivity you had before. And we can see that with salt, where people who have a high salt intake, when you cut down on their salt intake and then follow where salt in different foods, they start to judge it as more and more salt the less salt they eat. So they reverse the feeling they naturally have. And why is it good with salt not to eat too much of it? Because salt is actually vital. The problem is that our ancestors in the Stone Age ate about 1 gram of salt a day. Today, the average Danish eats between 7 and 11 grams a day. It is not uncommon to gain 15 grams. So like everything else, if you get 0 grams, it is really deadly. If you get 1 gram, it is good. Maybe up to 5 grams, we say from the Health Board. But if we go over there, there will be some consequences, among other things that you will increase the risk of getting high blood pressure. This increases the risk of getting a blood clot, which is one of the biggest deaths we have today. So really smart to take a detox on that. We also talk a lot about that there should be a scarring ban for children under 2 years. Is that also a way to ensure that they can feel life around them? You can say that where we develop ourselves most cognitively is in the early years. We don't have much experience with how this childhood affects you when you get older. Does it influence what preferences you have for your life? But you can imagine that when it is the most modellable age, that it might be in its place to do this and that we probably wouldn't lose anything by doing it. I would say that one Daniel who works here at the editorial office, he has just had a little child and then he bought an analog phone so he doesn't fall into the screen while he's on the floor. I think that's really nice. So for me it was a good picture of that, of shutting down. I have tried to be on silent retreat for five days and it's also completely crazy what you suddenly notice about nature and what's going on inside your head. All this about slowing down. We live in a society where we get this hyper-intelligence. The bots are extremely smart, but sometimes we need to slow down, step back and look at what's missing in this society that is not just a continuation of what is happening today. So could you imagine that it becomes a direct necessity if we are to contribute with value in 2050 as people? You can imagine that there is a part of the population that chooses this path. And we already have, not so much in Denmark, but abroad, population groups that are completely connected to modern technology, or have always done it, never been connected to modern technology. And we can see that if we look at something like Amish in the USA, they have a lot of children, so they grow up completely explosively. I mean, there were about 5,000 of them in 1900, now there are over 300,000. They will probably also reach around a million and then up to several million. That's interesting. Lars, are you not talking about the fact that more children are not being born now? Yes, that's interesting. If technology makes all those who are big consumers of technology not really want any children, then those who don't want to use technology will have many children. We can see in several different places that strong religious and technological groups grow explosively. And then of course it's a question of whether they can keep their members, but at least in the Amish it is over 90% of them who grow up, who also end up becoming believers themselves. So therefore their number grows so explosively. And so it's a kind of little wave, can't you say? They don't compare themselves to super-stimulated people who have done everything by themselves. And all the glitter pictures you took with them, and we were a bit up in the air, or what did you say? No, I mean, in comparison, no, their culture and religion is very much based on this with not having such status competition and to stand out in that way and everyone is equal and united in the way that there is no one who has a big cool car and no one and no one has a fat car. Lars, what do you say to that from Switzerland? Should we have a communist society where we all go in uniform? I'm a supporter of people being able to live as they want, if it doesn't bother others. So even though I'm a long way from being anish, I think it's good that people are allowed to do that. I would like to go to a third scenario. We've had one where companies are completely overwhelmed, both because they have the money and resources, and Lars and the others can't agree on where the stop button should be, so the governments can't be stopped. We can't control it on an individual level. We've had one where we go to the potato farm, press the stop button, do detox, all sorts of places in our lives to regain some senses. The third scenario must be that we make super stimuli for our friend. We use the weapon ourselves. And Niklas, I can't help but think about you were a student of the year and there has never been given so many 12-councils in Danish history when you were finished. Have you learned to take your own medicine? Do you use all these insights in your own life and is that why you are so good? Now there are of course others, there is a power limit you can reach and there are also some who reach it every year. But level, but I try to live by these rules. The books I write start out as my own attempt to understand something that I feel is relevant to my own life. And of course, if you want to achieve something in the real world, you have to keep some of these things in line. And if we look at how you can use it in a positive direction, for example, looking at TikTok at home versus TikTok in China, what is it that we see, for example, that China uses it as a super weapon for their children. China goes in and as always sets up some guidelines that they think should be valid for them. And in this case, it is that if you have completely free market resources, we can see that TikTok ends up being dominated by celebrity gossip, dance videos, and that kind of entertaining content, but not content that the Communist Party of China feels helps the Communist Party of China. Instead, they have made sure that more science, history and that kind of stuff, they have set some limits on how long you can use social media. There are warnings, you have been sitting here for half an hour, is this what you really want to do, or are you trapped in a flow-stage that you don't want to be in and then you can break out of it. Other places where you can do it is mandatory against depression. You should have a pet that promises to help you when you get home because then they are happy to see you and you are like the hero in their lives. Are there any tricks you can use? I just think that this thing about forcing people to do these things, makes it your own form of dystopia, which then just goes in the opposite direction. So I would say a more Western solution to this is to give the individual better opportunities to make their own decisions in life. Because what typically happens, if we take another area like smoking, where we can see that at least 70% of those who smoke say they want to stop, they just can't. So I would rather invent technologies that can help those who want to stop, to reach their goals, than that it should only be that we always set limits for what people are allowed to do. So you don't think we should have a smoking ban? Yes, because we don't have the opportunity to get rid of it. But as soon as we have technologies that could help people, so that we could do a survey of all those who smoke and they all say, yes, I smoke because I feel like it, then I think they should be allowed to do it as long as they don't harm others. But when we can see now that 70 of those who smoke don't want to do it, then it's clear that we have to help in a way that we can't do now, because we simply don't have the opportunity because nicotine is so common. What came now is, among other things, from Novo and Eli Lilly, a medicine that is a form of sub-stimulation that can reduce our need for smoking and alcohol, according to some studies. If nothing else, you can see that there is less food being sold in supermarkets because people have begun to dope themselves. Is that the way we should fight? Yes, you can see Rigovis as actually that we have made food that is unnatural appetizing and then we take medicine that turns our feeling of fullness unnatural higher to make them match again. But it is an example of giving people the opportunity. We can see that half of all adults try to lose weight in a given year and a large part fail. So there is clearly a need for people to eat in a different way are not able to because they are caught by these super stimuli. So I think that is an example of a way in which we, without regulating how people live their lives, at least gives them the opportunity to live out what they really want. Alcohol abuse is an example of an escalating super-stimulus and the hedonistic third wheel. In the USA, they made this ban on alcohol, which led to huge success for mafia movements and then they stopped it again. But did they do drugs? Yes, that's right. I would like to hear what the total consequences of that ban were. The total consequences were that it was incredibly unpopular and was withdrawn and that it led to organized crime. So in that way it was a huge disaster. But if you look at how many people were involved with different types of alcoholism and look at the best estimates we have for how much people drank, then alcohol was included. But it was just one of those situations where alcohol is a good example of that there are some who have trouble controlling their intake of alcohol and for others it's just one of these small pleasures that are actually cool. So those who enjoy alcohol are actually punished for having trouble controlling it. And it's the same if we look at food super stimuli. So it's not because I say that you are a bad person or that you will die early or something if you eat something bad and harmful and so on. I don't think there are people who don't do that. But as long as you are normal and healthy otherwise it's not a problem. The problem is more that there are heavy users who are caught in something that means abuse. The problem is not the super stimulant itself. The problem is that super stimulant leads to overexposure. And the problem is overexposure. And if you can not regulate your overexposure and the natural mechanisms your body has to try to keep itself healthy, then you get these problems. It's not always that easy to say that we will find the way for all these different super stimuli. There are definitely some that can only be solved by us at a state level, that we intervene and regulate. And I think that's also in its place to a certain extent. But the problem is that it can be difficult, and the problem is that it of course has the consequence that there are some of them who can control this, who get problems. When we are stimulated in one direction of our surroundings, there are examples of us being stimulated to do good and healthy things instead of being overwhelmed by random impressions and aggressive marketing. Of course there is. Many stimuli that come our way are made with positive intentions. It can be from large campaigns in the public space that seek to improve public health to completely effective gamification mechanisms in apps that rip and tear us apart to exercise motion more often or learn languages faster. Smartwatches that help to optimize sleep habits. Children's television that helps children to sort out the trash and put sugar water into the beers. Intellectual influencers that enlighten about mental health and all 17 world goals from the UN that tirelessly tries to gather the entire world's population to solve our many challenges in common. If we now take the last scenario here, that they actually become our friends. What now if we get that democratization with these personal AI and they coach you and tell you that it is very expensive today to go to a cost-saving leader. But now you can have someone who is there, who is in a certain situation with you, who is out shopping with you, who is going to a party with you, who is even on the nightstand. So how do you see it in 2050 that these personal AI can create some kind of empowerment against the big forces at stake? You can imagine that there are many areas where you can see that personal guidance is super effective. Without being completely sure, I also think it's one of the things you can see that gives the best result if you look at the students' learning, but of course it is not physically possible to have one teacher per student, but if you could have a personal EIS, it could be that we could accelerate learning. It could also be that it could be in the supermarket, or help you with different things. But the problem is, if you look at substance abuse, which is the extreme example, it's not because they don't know that it's harmful to health, the habit they've gotten into, or the abuse they've gotten into. The problem is that they're not physically able to let go and that there are some negative consequences if they try to let go. Now we are in 2050 and now you have to say if it is scenario 1, it is the companies, the commercial forces that have won, we are talking about Denmark in 2050. Or if it's two. We have stopped, we have taken a cold Turkish and we sense and feel and are much more in tune with the old year's collective society and look back with fear at the old parents. It's like when I see old family pictures, my mother is sitting with a big pregnant belly with a bag of ashes on her and she's sitting and asking herself, what did she think about? Are we going to look back like that? Or have we used these super stimuli to make ourselves super cool so we always get to know, now you have to get up, now you have to sit down, now you have to do this and that. I would like to start, because I am probably less clever than you, so I can be more precise. I mean that two and three actually belong together. So one, I am quite sure of the first thing, that our ability to get extreme stimulus will continue to grow because the technologies are clearly on the way. So it will be there, and then isolated it is just a bigger and bigger challenge. But then with regard to number second and third round, we can see when we look back at the history of innovation through a long time, we can see that our relationship to new technologies is always very problematic at the beginning. New cars were dangerous and rusted completely wild, and so on. And then they come better and safer cars cars and we get access to a lot of food. It takes a while before we find out that we should probably think about what we eat and we need to go to the gym, which our type of parents would find completely ridiculous to stand on a third wheel. Why would you do that? But we will get smarter and I think people will get a driving license for life, because we are more and more aware of it. The reason I say that two and three are a part of the driving license for life, is that you also learn to say, we also need to have digital detox, you also need to learn to have a digital detox, and to have a close relationship. You have to learn that there might be a thousand potential partners that you can find on a dating app, but there is not a perfect partner. You have to find one that is really good, and then you have to learn to live with the mistakes, and then live with the mistakes that both parties have. So we get Tinder with only four options. Niklas? I would like to play it a little bit. Yes, do it. Because the future I see, and as I also describe as a regular animal, it is really a mixture of these scenarios, just for different people. So what we see now... Can you give me some percentages of how many people are in each scenario? I'm curious about if there are 80 in each scenario or 50-50. The scenario I see is that we see some people being pulled in this direction. Extremely overweight, which would not be physically possible before. Extremely inactive, also extremely not living in the real world and having all their lives being served, without you going out and looking for it. On the other hand, we also have today the most cool people who have ever existed on the planet. Those who can run fast, those who can lift the most, also if we look back at Goblet of the Apes, those who fly the slowest. Some who just physically over-leg everything you could imagine in time. And in the same way we also have some of the people who achieve the most. Starts several billion companies in a single person. Will also be willing to be people who live today, who will go to Mars and build colonies up there. So we get this where the amount of opportunities is just being taken away from each other. It's like you're accelerating the pattern you already have in advance. So if you have a little tendency to self-destruction, it becomes extreme self-destruction. If you have a little tendency to self-development, then it becomes extreme self-development. And if it's the same size in every group, then you can imagine that you get a normal distribution, where normal people are in the middle. But they don't do that, they get phased in every direction. Yes, so it gets pulled out, but you are at least out in the extremes, and you get people who are even less present in the present and even less physically active and so on, and some who can achieve even more, things we couldn't imagine today, individual people can do. And something we haven't talked about that much, we've talked a lot about individual level, but in these 2050, one of the most important stimuli we need is to be able to build things together. Is there room for that or are we all going out in our own... It's interesting if you can create such artificial creations that are cool to be together with in all ways. If are some who simply say that they don't need to be with real people, because it would be like watching a movie in black and white today. Why would you give it if you can see them in color? It's just more stimulating to be with these who are adapted to us. There is a question that comes in at the beginning, that even though something maybe hedonic would be more stimulating, then it could be that there are certainly some who still choose the less hedonic stimulating, but that gives more meaning, where there is more joy of meaning. Then I would like to say thank you for being with us, Niklas. It was as always super inspiring, super stimulating, and I hope that you who are listening out there can see that there are different scenarios. It's also about choosing the direction your life should be in. We have all the possibilities to destroy ourselves and build fantastic things. Lars, now we're going to the Lune Round. Is it a nice or need to have with some super stimuli? I know they're coming. They're on their way. We already have them. The important thing for me is, is it nice or need to have and learn to tackle them. And I think it's almost need to have, because otherwise we get a dystopian future. Then it will be the worst version of model 1. Well said. Should we be prepared for this to go extremely fast? It is really a weapon race. I can't understand why you don't use it in the weapon industry. Why don't they stimulate us instead of shooting us down? But that's a completely different story. Will this make it go fast or slow? I would just like to say that there are some who think that the Chinese are trying to undermine the West by saying that TikTok is a lesson in China, but not in the West. I don't think that's what's happening, because they don't control what's going on in the West. But you can clearly use it in psychological crisis management. What was the question? How fast or slowly does it come to stimulate new heights? Much of it is beyond what has already come, especially within Narko, it is. It is about stimulating new heights. Yes, a lot of it is, besides what has already come, especially within NACO, of course, it is just around the corner and a lot of it is exponential. Is it difficult or difficult to invest in? You can choose which scenarios you want to invest in. It is really difficult. There are people on the internet who have begun to talk about Denmark as a sluggish medicine with a country that is hanging as a pendant. So there is money in the shit. So really. So just as much as there is money in doing what is dangerous or potentially destructive, there is money in coming up with solutions to it. Rich, sustainable or clever? Rich and clever, I would say. But it is a supertrend? It is a supertrend. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends. If you have comments, questions or suggestions, you can finally write to us on social media.

You can put it up for example to a mirror and see how it looks with the clothes on. There are some things we will try out and then we will find out that it might not be as easy as we thought. We have to avoid anxiety and depression. People have to go out and they have go to the shops. You can also personalize that by getting a notification when someone steps into your business. That way you can call them and say, welcome, I would like to tell you about the phone, but the shop owner... Put your video on, so I can see if the BH fits. This is Supertrends, where we investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsøe. Every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrends, Lars Tvede. Welcome to the future. Do you know the feeling of entering a shop and seeing the most beautiful carousel? You just can't stand and sweat in a test room with a dark light, take off your clothes, stand there completely sleepy with the clerk just looking in and asking if they can help. Of course, new business models are coming out in 2050. Now we're going completely crazy about countering the shop's death. I was in to taste some cheese. The whole shop was one big tasting place. I tasted so many gouda cheese. Then I was in another place where they gave you some healed water. And I thought, can you really make a premium location just with water that has been healed and got all kinds of minerals that will make you live healthier and longer. And then there was another one, where it was a quiz, where you could find out how old you were. And when I got into those makeup stores, it was the wildest showroom. There was a boy at every mirror. And the funny thing was that I saw so many men with eye shadows, lipsticks, and... ...and I don't know what. So there's already a lot happening now, in relation to that if you're making a shop, then it should be able to do something, besides just have some clothes on a shelf. But Lars, you walk in such a beautiful dress. How do you shop? Now you're fortunately a talk show, but I'm a weak sarcasm. No, it's completely anonymous. Well, okay. I prefer to shop online. I really like that. So can send it back if that's okay. When Amazon came out, I went completely shop-amok with CDs and DVDs. You bought that back then, it was before streaming. And books. So I think it's strange that I've bought more I have bought over a thousand objects. But it was also one of the most successful online transitions. It was these books with Amazon. Yes, of course, because there are so many titles and no bookshop can cover it all. But Amazon can. So, Lars, what do you think if we look into the future? We have three experts with us today. So, shouldn't we jump into the timeline? Yes, we do. SuperTrendsMaschinen is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives a clue as to when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. I would like to say that retail shopping is almost 70% of an economy that runs through it. So it's a very large area. So what we see is that in 2025, about 10% of retailers want virtual fitting rooms. That means you can stand up for example to a mirror and then you can just see how I want to look with this and that clothes. Even if you have other clothes on? Even if you have other clothes on. Instead of all the mess and then they have to find one in your size, then you have to go out and look and stuff. So it might be before you actually buy it, that you want to try it, but you would like to see a whole lot of possibilities online. And then there is something called Omniverse, and Omniverse means that you can go to many different digital places and there will be virtual businesses in many different formats from the metaverse to websites and mobile. When you enter a shop you have an artificial intelligence shopping assistant, which means you enter a shop, you have an Art Intelligence Shopping Assistant. You enter a shop with a variety of things, and you say you are interested in something. For example, I'm going to a wedding party on Wednesday. And then the assistant takes over and says you have to go up to the third room, and then you can go there and compare it with that. And then you can ask some questions. And doing a relevant AI, we will, or a lot of people will have what is called personal AI, that is to say you have an AI that assists you in general in life with everything. And then you can, against money presumably, you can then provide information about you, but without them identifying who you are. And retailers can use that to make market analysis. That means, normally you call people in to discuss. Focus groups. Yes, focus groups to discuss a new product, but in reality you can have these virtual AIs to evaluate it. So to speak it non-stop in real time. So they can run very large transactions where they can evaluate everything between heaven and earth. Then there is 2027, also a big breakthrough for smart mirrors in businesses. It is a screen, but it is also a mirror. Suddenly it becomes a mirror for something where you see yourself with different things. Something that in general also exists in fitness training. Then there is a breakthrough, especially in 2028, that you can shop via You see something happening on social media and then there is product placement, and then it's just click to buy. I thought we would have had that much before. Yes, but what we are talking about here is when there are numbers on all these estimates. When you think about how much time is spent on YouTube and TikTok, you would think it was much more extensive. There are numbers on this that say that over 90% of large retailers have it at that time, so it's not that it doesn't exist today. So in 2029 drone deliveries from large physical businesses. Then comes the metaverse, which is not really used through big yet. It is expected to be used through 2030 and then every fifth larger retail company will invest in owning metaverse, so you have to buy yourself some places. It requires that we come in with those huge, heavy goggles and get some contact lenses or something smarter on. Yes, that's a whole story in itself. Then we are on our way out of the mass production of the industrial country and then to that mass individualization. And as part of that, there will be what is called hyperlocal retail, that is, businesses that are extremely adapted to what people are interested in, similar to this specific environment at this specific time. And as part of that comes what is called micro-fulfillment centers, which becomes which is a hybrid between online and physical purchase. Where you order online, you can get it delivered even if it's a bit. Then there is something that is expected to be very big in shipping, that is huge container ships. You can order it should be a green delivery, that is that you can order Green Delivery, which means that the transport has to be environmentally friendly, and you can get Green Delivery from your goods if you want to pay a little extra for it. And then in 2034, it will be expanded and you will have robots that serve you in the shops and you can also have a robot with you that carries everything you have bought. And then the last thing I want to bring here is that it starts in 2041, it really becomes more common to order something online and then it will be printed out with a 3D printer. It's completely individualized. A format within retail that is expected to shape future customer experiences is the concept of Fidgetal. It is a fusion of physical and digital that is about integrating functions in the physical customer experience. So the customer experiences a hybrid of comfort, service and autonomy. Today it can be in the form of self-service solutions where you are in showrooms without interacting with a physical person, or as home-based AR solutions, where you set up the living room virtually before you buy the goods. In the future, the digital extension will play an even bigger role, so you can, for example, offer sanitary-based tasting tests at the holiday destination before you buy the trip. We are talking about the future of retail and shopping. With us today we have Mette Louise Kågaard. She is the administrative director of Microsoft Denmark and Iceland. Welcome. Thank you. And then we have Gregory Christensen. You are a co-founder of ProRoom, who works on making shopping open. Yes, sales service. Welcome to the show. And, Ian Wisler, you are the king of customer experiences. You have come with Kaja here, and you have a for Tivoli and you are also a lecturer and author. Welcome. Thank you very much for the little honor. We will start by asking you, Mette, what do you see as the biggest challenges in terms of making the shopping and retail experience better? For example, when it comes to chatbots. We get very upset and angry when they don't understand what we say. If we are, for example, dissatisfied with a product and we can't get a real person. I actually think there are a lot of good solutions in the market. Just to start there, I'm a very positive person. But what is of course really important here is that technology has to be able to handle an interaction with a person. And that is one of the new technologies we see coming out now. These language models are much better than some of the technology we have seen before. But what is super important to get a good experience is that the technology you use is mature enough. It doesn't have to be that full mature, but it has to be mature enough to be used for what it is now used for. And if you have to point to one case that points towards the future, what would it be? Well, I think there are many really exciting cases. We have a customer in Italy who makes shoes. They try to make a virtual reality connected to a digital twin so you can make your own shoes and develop it with colors and sizes and what kind of sole and then you can make it. I think it's for the few, it sounds relatively expensive and I can also be a little bit doubtful about all the technology that is used in it is quite enough to make it very full blown. But it's one of the funny cases we see. I myself bought a car from an upstart where you could choose and the style. It feels fantastic to get something that is completely original for you. We women can talk about that. Then you are sure that you won't get a car where everyone has the same. Another thing I want to ask you, Mette. Something that frustrates me a lot is that the reason we have this support from the stores is that you are so very uncomfortable with customer service. It costs a lot to make these frames and then people say, oh how nice you have shown me all these shoes and boots. Now I buy them for half the price on the net from someone who is uncomfortable with the customer experience. So you can create a whole new business model where you can say, here I was actually really in love with this bag thanks to this fantastic customer experience. There should be some form of cashback, because then we can start making stores again. Yes, we could hope that Gregory can take a little bit of that. There is no doubt about it, just to take it, that there is some extra service to get it to happen. But I'm sure it can be done. I just think you have to think about the shopping experience in a completely different way than you do today. When we got Netflix and TV to show more movies, we were afraid that the biographers would die. They haven't done that at all. Ordinary Flow TV is also available. So when you can make the right models of the reality we've all been used to be in, until then, and look forward to it, then I think we've shown that we can succeed in something. So I'm super excited to see what Gregory is going to say about it. I'd like to give you some words, Gregory Christensen. You've made these pro-rooms, and they're actually unmanned stores. And one of the most expensive things is to have people in them. So already there, we can get it a little cheaper. Can you tell us a little about the concept? In 2016, I was sitting with a friend and we all tried this with that you want to go out and you have seen a sofa online and then you want to go into the store. And then the store was closed when you have free time. And I thought, we thought, we should let ourselves do that. Solve this with technology. All these retail stores have expensive businesses, are located in expensive locations, pay 100,000 kr. in rent per month and then they are closed after 6 pm. So that was the start of ProRoom and what we also thought was that you can go against this store, you can increase the profit on existing locations by expanding this opening time and you can do that by it becoming self-service. So imagine you are going to a kitchen or sofa business and there's a short guide and you swipe on midi-day and then the door opens and the lights turn on, the music plays, you get a welcome message, you're invited to talk to the chatbot who knows everything about the products, who asks which products you are interested in, who can help you to guide you. So that's the solution we have come up with, which will help the businesses to stay open, so they can just open. They don't need to be completely unmanned, but it can run completely unmanned. I can imagine a sinful rule, at least when I have tried some shirts through. And then you have the cleaning staff that comes in. It's clear that there must be a scheme for that. It can be that you as a shopper have to wait on how nicely you have left the store. The Chinese could find out or someone else, but I hope we don't get up right here. That's super exciting. I'd like to have you, Ian Wisler, on the stage, because I know that it's human touch. We have high tech and high touch. It may well be that cashiers don't have to run their goods through the cashier anymore. But the fact of being able to spot trends and see you and give you a spiritual hug in a time when 40% live alone, that's something to be proud of. How much does that experience mean? We don't go out and buy in because we really lack so much. No, Exactly. And you can say that it can really be that we miss it. But we didn't know. No, it's really smart that we say that. Everything that can be done. I think Mette has made a really good point about the fact that technology be tough enough. When I go out and shop, I have to get hold of the products and as Craig said, we can optimize that. We can make it easy and smart and a really cool experience, but it just doesn't hit me in the heart. And you can say that where there is something that can hit the heart, it is where people can come into play, because they can do something else and they can hit me emotionally in a way that I, I mean, the machine can do it easily. And I easily stumble, but there are just some moments that become magical, which become the moments I want to tell others about. Now I'm just past the bakery on the way here to buy cake, and it wasn't the cake that was magical, but the moment I had with her who was inspecting me. I said to her, you really did a good job. She said to me, we're going back and forth, can't you put some happiness on top of the cake? I said, I'm not going to decorate it with a flag, so now there's a flag on the cake. And it's just like that, and then that little moment we have together, and it has nothing to do with the cake, it has nothing to do with what I'm buying to do, but something is just happening in this little moment, and I can't find it in a machine, because it gives me answers to what I'm asking about, and then it might come come with a joke if it's good. And that's why I'm asking, now that Microsoft is represented here today, that this moment of happiness that you two have together is snapped up and converted, because as long as there is no business model in it, then I can understand that there are some who get tired of standing up with a big smile and going the extra mile every day, but then the air goes out of the balloon because there are others who do other things. So we have to think about it in some way. I think it will also be about what products we buy and where. It's probably hard to send a cake when it's bought online with OOPS. I can see how it looks when it comes in the door when it has been rolled around in the car 24 times. On the other hand, there will be some clothes, shoes, furniture and things like that it actually works super well that you get it delivered, also because it's actually a small problem to let go of it while you're running around in the city. So I think that if you can create the experience and find the special thing that can make you go there to buy something instead of sitting at home in the sofa and buying it online. That's what it's all about. And you can say that Gregory's model has something called 24-7 always open, super convenient for me, so I don't need to use my Saturday for that. And I don't have time during the week. So I think it's really about what we buy and where. Yes, and that with convenience, it always wins. We know that the dovetail and that it's easy, it's a bit of a struggle. It's actually not quite right, because when we take the example of first going down to the store and spend a lot time there, and then you go home and order it, and use that extra risk of something breaking when it's delivered, there's also a price. There are both parts, and it's about connecting those things in the right way. Gregory, what do you think? Can we really handle chatbots and unmanaged stores? Is it a replacement or a supplement? It's a combination. So today we have customers where you book a time if you want to meet someone, if you want to have it personal. And that's so effective for the store, because they know that someone is coming up here, and then they can plan accordingly. So it becomes a combination, and it depends on what product categories you work with. In addition, you can also personalize this by, for example, getting notifications when someone enters your business. And then in that way you can call them up and say, welcome, I would like to tell you about the phone, but the shop owner... Put your video on, so I can see if the BH fits. Exactly. It just gives the shop owner the flexibility that he also needs, because there are a lot of retailers today that are both delivering and selling at the same time, so they are out delivering goods. And in this way, they can also have people coming into their store. Now we are going to look at 2050. Japan Airlines has launched an experimental extension service called Anywhere Anywhere. Here, travelers send in their body measurements a few weeks before departure and find a wardrobe filled with outfits in their precise size when arriving at the destination. The concept partly points towards a future where holiday shopping starts already before departure and towards a future where circular economy and 3D printers create Jan, you have worked in this experience economy for many years. If we look further ahead, what are the experiences, are there things we take for granted today that will become wildly exotic in the future? Or what do you think surprised us the most when we are there in 2050? My wife likes to trade daily goods online and I like to go to the physical store, so I go to the internet. And then we talked about why I go to the internet. Well, it's to get out. And even in the then I go out to see other people and observe other people. And now it may be that I'm a bit of a nerd in my area, but there is not the big kissing experience. I get out of the door. I free myself from depression because I get out and get fresh air. It's just as much a huge huge problem. I know Lars, you know Morten Münster, he recently referred to a study of 1300 studies of depression, where they say that the most common factor was that the healing was to get fresh air and move.. So just going out and taking a walk. I thought maybe it would help. I don't wear clothes every day, but I have to buy a lot of daily goods. And then you divide them up, so you buy one thing at a time, so you can go out again and again. Exactly! It can be that I think it's difficult, but it's something I'm still doing. If we want to go further in retail and exclusive products, where I can see something interesting happening, and as you said in the beginning, is where the store can offer something that is difficult to access digitally. For example, when I was in London, where I worked with these different soap, something they work a lot with is to stir the soap. So there is a washing machine, and it is only five years ago, and they throw the soap into the washing machine, so you can see how they bubble. You stand and wash them in your hands, and I can feel it when I do it. You smell it, there is a worker standing in the entrance with a large carpet foam on the entrance, and spits foam out, so there is foam and magic. When I enter the store, I enter an experience. I can do a lot on the screen, and I know that a lot is done with smell. It's been 20 years since then. You can help me with that. It's been a long time, but it's not the same. When my little son... And by 2050, what will it be? It will be crazy. Because again, I want to get in there. And that's where Gregory's work becomes insanely exciting, because how can I do this and add that extra element of something I'm going into, and that's the universe. And technology can do insanely much. Something that always works is if it's about me. Exactly. So how can you create a Saba experience that is about you at the same time? With the help of new technology, with the help of data that can recognize you and in a way can take you to someone who might even know your wife and know if you have a relationship. I would like to ask about another thing, because this is also something that has led to product bulimia. product problem. We have it that 40% of the clothes we have bought, is not actually used. Maybe because you go out in a fresh weather and think, I have absolutely nothing at home. So, Mette, when can you scan what you have in your wardrobe and get that thought into the future and maybe get some virtual packages. I know you have made CoPilot at Microsoft, which also helps us in our work life, but this is a huge climate expression we put. Could something about the experience and the climate? I could imagine having an electronic wardrobe when I'm out shopping. Just because I'm at home and buying something online, you can't really remember what's in there. So I think you can do something. And you can use different forms of technology to track what you have, and maybe also if you borrow it or buy something together. It's something that also becomes very modern, all this share economy. Who is it that has the bowl that we bought that was super expensive? And we already see some of those who are on the market today. Frederikke with Rockhamore, she is starting to do something where she tracks her products completely crazy to say we have a really climate friendly product here. And it's just part of her brand to do it too. And her stores are also an experience to get into. So she's starting to connect some of those things. And what do you think about Kurata, your co-pilot? You shouldn't send that text message to the boss, because then it doesn't look good. We can see that with the pattern recognition. Can it also say, you probably shouldn't take a job interview in such a big place? Yes, it would be quite generous to say that if someone had used it on an electronic dress. It's not something I've seen anyone who has done somewhere, but there are an incredible number of possibilities here. I think in reality, there is again a price for it. I also think that some of the things are simply too cheap when we have so much hanging in our closet. It's not good for the environment. If we could raise the prices a little bit, we could have a little more cash with what we bought and it could be produced in a proper way. You could hope for the future so you have all this data coming in, but what about the trendspotter muscle you have towards 2050? Will it always be in dialogue, like Jens, the lady who really talks to him and gets a pretty quick sense that times are changing? Do we lose that muscle in 2050 if a lot happens through data and less through dialogue? I don't think so. I think there will be a lot of solutions to these things, also about what was talked about before. So this My Closet. There are already apps to control what you have. The delivery problem is something where it is good to get people out and try things, then they have greater security. Does that work with My Closet? For some it does. Of what I know, most women use it, but there are a lot of women who have fixed it. I don't look happy with it. It's just super easy. It should be like this when I buy it, it lands in there. If I have to fix it myself, I doesn't happen to me. We're going back to the convenience store. They should make it easier with NFC chips, so that when your clothes arrive at your closet, it tells your app that it's this item. It can be done. So that was just to give an example. There are some who have started in that direction. It will get better and better. And the future of the store, well, there are so many things. It will be stores everywhere. There are also apps today where you can go into a hotel and say, if I'm interested in that chair there, get it delivered home. It will be everywhere. You will have self-driving stores, kiosks. Some do it on a low level today, but more will come. I can't stop thinking about you, Gregor, because you said self-driving, and then I think of Tupperware parties, which were very big. But imagine if a self-driving bus showroom came out and you were all party instead of party bus, you were party shopper and then you went into that showroom and got a proper experience. All that community, the show, is something that has really taken over the social media. You go live, people are talking together. It's that which creates joy. You are painting each other, you are imagining yourselves, you are co-creators. I could imagine that, but do we need to wait for the self-driving car? No, not really. There are container solutions with container showrooms where you can come in and borrow the product from your midi-day and then take it with you and drive. There are some bicycle companies that have started this. There is much more of it. So if we look very far ahead, the technologies will be so good that they will plan. Already today you can see from Snapchat where there is a lot of activity. Get your container there, play a place for a month, go up on social media, get an influencer in, then the shopping experience starts, have a little party with DJ in the evening, all those things about the product. So absolutely, it's much more flexible, agile, it can move so quickly, technology, we can communicate so quickly to each other. Yes, now we have those influencers, they fill us insanely much. I know that L'Oréal pays a lot of money here in Denmark, about 40,000 to 1.000, who just need to make 3 posts or something. Some kind of business model, but also very vulnerable, because some of the real influencers sometimes make mistakes and do something stupid. And then you suddenly don't know them at all, and they can be involved in the development of your brand. So, in the year 2050, we will have some virtual influencers, that are not in reality, but that we will still be inspired by, in relation to how we dress. We have a gamer generation on the way, who are used to buying skins and leather. I think so too. And it's just that it makes me know myself better than I know myself because it's based on data. And you get your own avatar that becomes your own influencer. And in that sense, influencers are just the beginning. So it's hard to say where it's going. I'm sure it will explode, it will get much wilder, but I also think the idea that you have your own, which is actually one, but that it understands one. Then we've talked a lot about robots, but Mette, when do we start to get those... I've been out eating sushi with robots on the restaurant floor. I think it's more of a gimmick than a funny thing. In 2050, are you used to robots walking around, falling and laying on the floor? I'm looking forward to having one at home. It's just something to say. So you don't have to clean the washing machine and the other things. There is a time limit, but we are on the right track. I think we all have someone who can help us. There are many who can help us. Do you have someone to help you with the laundry? I have someone to help me with the laundry a dog, so I'm a bit against that. And as they say about Universal Robots, we see it in the industry. It's being tested seriously in relation to working for us at home. And with drones. We have the technology to do it. What do you think about these cute bots that run around 24-7 and never keep free or sleep in your store, Gregory? It will be there. It has already started. You can call one up called Tally. It counts how many products are around so you can fill up. Maker robots. T. Hansen has just announced that they are making all their new robot labs within the next three years, because it is so good in relation to click and collect. Again, it's about convenience. It's about getting the product in the hands of the customer as quickly as possible. So yes, there will only be more robots that do different functions that are repetitive. I have a question. It goes quite generally whether there are shops in 2050. I don't know the answer, but I think I just have a fantasy whether there may be a long-term cause is that there is suchtrance in technology that is a given technology that is more and more advanced until it finally disappears. It does not mean that the advantage of it disappears, but it is just embedded, integrated into something else. And our smartphones have integrated 30 different things at the same time. So you have to fill a whole house with all the hardware stuff that is now in it. So if you imagine a world where if you come to a physical place and it gets you to buy in, then it doesn't appear as a retail machine. It appears as a bar, a reception or something else. And if it's a reception, then the furniture and the whole interior has been delivered for free by a company. Because everyone who sees these furniture thinks, oh my God, it's nice. They can just click to buy when they see it. Now I'm thinking Truman Show, where it's all one big product placement. I'm just thinking about the whole concept, but with such big things, where you come in to buy in, actually fades over the next 30-40 years. If we want to have some cases, which I find interesting, then it's for example also in relation to you, Ian, with experiences, like Nike, who have made some wild showrooms now, where they measure your pulse, they measure your way of exercising. They try to make clubs, communities, where you compete against each other, and then the sale of products is a side of it, so you go in there and then they make a mini sports venue with everything from basketball to... and people are there and hanging out. Exactly, and you can say that, because I talk into the experience, so it becomes like a nothing. So it's about the sport and me and I finally become the. And then it's just an artifact or a requisite that I need to use. But it's about me and how I work out my sport. So I'm sure there will be a lot more. Can you say something about how much of an experience is irrational? You have also worked in Thivoli, and some of us are of course rational, we need a shirt or we need a cup of coffee, but how much of it is actually the experience that comes with it, that is my story? It's probably hard to put a number on, but if I were to refer to Peiner Gilmour's Experience Economy, where they also talk about the economy of transformation, then you can say that buying coffee as a commodity, the amount of coffee I need to make one cup of coffee, now in 2023, between 1 and 4 kronroner, I can get the whole spectrum of what I can get from coffee. From the cheapest discount to the most expensive luxury. 1 to 4 kroner. If I buy it as an experience, it's between 25 and 80 kroner. I don't get more than a cup of coffee. There are some who have cup and made the coffee for me. It says something about the experience. If we take it to the transformation economy, then it's like taking the Basta Rista course. Now I have to learn to make it myself. I have to learn to make the good cup of coffee. Then it's just 400-600 kroner. It's still a product I could have bought between 1-4 kroner, the whole spectrum, if I just did it myself. And we're not out in the field of art, because then it costs over 1000 kroner. It's super interesting, because it's the same now that you bought cakes, but if you were on a cake baking course, then we were also up there. Completely. And if we are up in 2050, then we would like to change. Your K-Bot method should change the job market. But how can it change our way of being in the world? It is a very good balance. On the one hand, we should do something better, smarter, stronger, avoid product bulimia. Can you imagine that we are doing something better, not just more in 2050? I think the first step we want to see, at least in these new technologies we are introducing, is something you can't see. So it's the layer optimization, that you produce the right amount of products, that you distribute them correctly in the stores, that the pricing becomes the right one, and that you drive as efficiently as you can. And it will be as green as you can at all, because you can control it accordingly. So I think in reality it will be the very first big step we see with technologies. It's down at the bottom of the Maslow's pyramid. It's also about safety, for example. Yes, it's also about safety. So it's super important, also because we have a trend in 2050, that we start to become better at producing and being more effective in that. But I think that will be the first big step, and therefore there will be a lot of retailers that will benefit from it. And then it will move towards the consumers afterwards. I don't think I have the imagination to imagine where it will end. I look at some niche YouTubers, for example in New York, you have to use it in New York and then you put it down for reuse when you're done using it there. So Gregory, could you imagine that we have some other technologies also in-house so that we don't need to have it all delivered? We are living in a geopolitical, somewhat crisis-like situation where we can't expect to use China as a cheap production place and other places not towards 2050. These self-service solutions are always opening up for the recycling economy. The recycling stations in Denmark have opened up a few of them and they will spread to other places. And then this with improved delivery possibilities, drone delivery, then take the used goods somewhere, get them to a new location where they can then be sold to another audience that is there. Is it called recycle and upcycling? There are many words, recycle and upcycle. There are many trends in it, and you can say all these improvements in technology, it just helps that it can be done. Just as people can find the product online, they can also find out where it is and then they can get it when it suits them. How important is it that it is a part of our history, that it has been elsewhere before and it has to go elsewhere and it is circular. We have a generation that is not sure that they can expect the climate to be as stable as it is today, when we look at 2050? How much do we tell with our consumption who we are in the world and where we want the world to go? It fills more and more. And we also want to be entertained and experience the history of where it has been. And we want to talk about the right political attitude, so we want to do it correctly. But on the other hand, I came to think about it before, with Mette and thinking about the shopping experience differently. There is some sustainability in it, and as Greg is also on it. I heard from bestsell sellers, I talked to them, where they said, the t-shirt I buy when I buy an online t-shirt, there are nine others who have had it at home. That's not so good. It's a bit unfortunate to talk about sustainability, that it has been out nine times. It has to be transported by something and it has to be transported back again. And that's unfortunate. But you can say a lot more and these communities, but again, a lot of what we're looking for is the real thing. I'm talking to Dina from Champagnekassen, Champagne for Everyone, and where the really strong thing is that they have limited the number of members and that they send out personal video greetings and also those who withdraw from their products because their members say, well, it's so good, it's not really because we drank champagne, but now we've just suddenly got an artifact that makes us see each other. We have a couple of friends that we see because the champagne box is coming. It's about that experience. It's the community that you become part of something bigger. Exactly. And they encourage us. It's the story where Michael, your husband, is directly involved. He is down to be with the autumn. So again, storytelling and the right product. And they are completely involved from the start. And that story becomes more and more important. We want to make sure that the political agenda becomes more and more important. We have had some gamers on the show, and they say that like we talk about racism today, we want to have virtualism in the future. That means that if someone says to someone that it's not as good when it's virtual as when it's physical, then get really angry because they think the physical and the virtual are melting together. We don't see a difference when we look at 2050. We just see that there are different layers on the existence and we don't think about one thing being one thing and the other being another. But I think that already in some cases we don't do that. So I think that already, it's a very short answer, but I'm thinking why do I answer like that. I think when I buy clothes online, I end up getting a physical item at home. I order it online. Some people start by going to the store and ordering the item online before they go home and order it. So it might not be that effective, but it starts to blend together. Are we good at knowing the difference between what and what? Can we see what an avatar is when we talk to someone like that? Or a robot when we talk to someone like that? And can we see what a human is when we talk to someone like that? That's something I hope the regulation we also have to look into will help us a little bit. Because I'm old-fashioned enough to think that it's very nice to know if it's one thing or another. Do you have other cases, like against 2050, where you think it points forward in terms of doing things in a completely new way? Iren was talking about the fact that it's a problem if we have to send things back and forth nine times. It would be nice to get one of the carriages out once in a while and check that everything is fine. I was thinking that these language models are actually really good at designing. You can get whatever you want. And then I thought, if you could start with 3D printing clothes or do something else, that you might be able to get it delivered in a completely different way. Get a right to print or even make a design, but to give material with a given logo on it, for example. Now I'm just imagining something else, I'm not a future researcher here. But I think maybe you could solve some of the things we've talked about and at the same time get a personalized experience out of it. We're playing with technologies that are here today and both are good today. 3D printing works well. You use it in the industry. Instead of sending spare parts around, you use 3D printing for that. And these language models are really good at designing. Then you just need to have a mark on it and be able to print in some different materials, so you can have something sent in some way. It also counts in the so-called prosumer movement, which has been going on for a long time, where you are both a consumer and a producer. And if you can be involved in designing products, maybe go out in the store and see it printed in 3D in front of you, and you know it's your own design or a lost logo or something, then is a part of the experience economy. I also think that the virtual versus the physical, we also have to see that many times what we want to buy or what we want to have or the information we want to have, where it is not necessarily, whether it is virtual or physical, but we can provide the information in another way. So there is not, now I work with some banks for the time being, and then I got some numbers from them that we have 0.4 meetings with our bank managers per year. 0.4! That means we meet with our bankers every 2.5 years. And then we can talk on the phone with them and visit their website. Then it gradually increases. A regular customer visits his mobile app 214 times a year. I didn't go to the bank 214 times before, but I constantly check my mobile app to check my balance. You also have to do it with all the cybercrime out there. Exactly. But I don't think that I have to go to the bank because I want to have a physical meeting to check my balance. I couldn't dream that I wouldn't even call my bank advisor. No, no, they don't have time. Before I pressed the first button on the phone number, I checked my balance, because a product has arrived. And that's where Gregory and Mette's solutions become fantastic, because they solve something else. But when I I sit there and talk to my advisor, she also needs something else. She doesn't have to give me my salary, because I don't need it. But we need to be able to discuss the economy in my life. And that was also something we talked about, Lieselotte, that I had a meeting with my bank advisor. If you need to get divorced so you don't have to go into the net all the. That too! But where I'm sitting there with my bank account and talking and now I've been given the plan for the rest of my life and it was just a conversation we had that ended up being a very long conversation but where we suddenly talk about other things that we get out of a conversation. It's really nice that you say that, because you also say that there is a job for the industry in 2050, because you just have to do something else. I just want to have you on the line one last time, Gregory, because there is a lot of innovation happening. We can see how fast it is going with IRN and banks and things on. So can you even afford to own something in the future? Imagine if the development is going so fast that it is smart to have some leasing agreements. Could you imagine that with your day-opening stores that you can just go in and switch to the latest new things, at least within NewTek, you don't want to have a 5-10 year horizon. Absolutely. This shared economy will continue to grow, it will expand to other areas. So what it has already seen within all sorts of things, and Airbnb and people who drive cars, etc. It will just expand because technology makes it possible, makes it very fast and people are getting used to it incredibly fast. Again, this example from the physical bank advisor to now I can check him online. Well, people are getting used to it. There is no one asking if the metro is running. It runs, they completely turned around. People actually take new technologies extremely quickly as long as it is convenient. They get very, very annoyed if it is not convenient, if it is not fast and so on. And there is an expectation about that. So we will see a lot of things, I would also like to mention about this with experiences. It will of course be combined more with retail. Today you have a lot of mystery game places opening up, but I think in the future it will be combined. It will also be a store where the mystery game takes place. Mette, last remark about what surprises you the most about 2050? I was just thinking about the example with the bank, where I think, we can already see it on cars, that it's super expensive to buy a car, and people just buy it online. It's one of the biggest economic decisions, to buy a house, you can't make. So I think, I don't think we can imagine where it goes go. It's fun to hear this. We'll take a quick look around. Do we have stores you can go out and into in 2022? Yes, we do. And it will be in all sorts of ways. We have to avoid anxiety and depression. People have to go out and they have to go out to the stores. And meet each other. Yes, and they want to be personalized to a degree where people love it. Like they get recommendations from YouTube, Music and everything else. Then they think, wow, this shop knows me. Are the goods delivered in the night, fog and darkness? Are there robots or what happens to it? I think that's something you can imagine when you've been out and seen a all the things you could have thought of bringing home and you don't want to carry it on. Thank you very much for being with us. Here are three ways that robot technology is expected to affect the future shopping experience. 1. Expect a personal shopper who guides you, compliments you and gives you recommendations for your look based on your budget, your purchase history and the trend of the time. The robot is ready at the entrance and is either delivered on a minute basis or offered as a natural service in extension of the brand. 2. Delivery robots in shopping centers that are constantly transporting your goods to a collection point at the exit, so you don't have to carry them or just go home to them when they are on their way. 3. On the way out of the store, robots will stir up informal conversations with you to gather feedback about the customer experience, which can be used as a recommendation to the next customers or to give the store manager specific inputs for optimization. What do you think, Lars? More gamification, more walking on the streets, more taste maybe, because everything is hidden in the shadows. So when we finally get out, we have to feel something, we have to move as people. I think that in all that was said here, which was very exciting for me in any case, was that I could categorize everything into experience economy or convenience. It should be easy. And then there are some things where you can combine it. For example, I said earlier that I bought a lot of CDs and DVDs in the old days on Amazon. And it's products that speak to me, because I can actually hear something from the music, I can read something from the book before I buy it, but of course I can't talk to the expedient in a cake shop, like in the bakery. Now we didn't get into the other business models so much, we know that with the plane tickets, they are going up and down. And now you have just tried to auction a first class seat in a plane. Could you imagine that the prices on everyday things will fluctuate when there are not more people going to the supermarket for milk? Then it will suddenly become cheap? It to upgrade to business. So they auction those that are available, if there are any available. So High Bidder offer an upgrade to business. So they will share with those who are available, if there are any available. So highest bidder for us is an upgrade to business. Now we have to see if it works economically for them, but they are trying to do that. What I think is going to happen is exactly that. I think it was interesting, the comment that you go out because you are sitting too much at home, even though it is quickly, which is not the biggest experience in the universe. But there is a lot that indicates that the physical experience should be a great experience. If there are more who are at home working and just sitting at home with the computer, then they have an even bigger desire to go out to do something physically, but it should be a big experience. And it may not have to be a character of a shop, it is an embedded shop inside something else, inside a restaurant or something. And there you just said something essential, I think, Lars, because we are starting to spend more time at home. It's not just some sleeping towns. And that means that there might be some change in the local store life again, because you just spend the whole day, go out and air the dog, go down and have some breakfast, do one thing or the other. So there's a little more decentralization, and it's not just happening in these big malls. Yes, and I think it's under a convenience. There is a lot of customizing, a lot of individualization, where each person can get a completely unique product. Just like you can go online and design your own car, which results in some car brands that really have 10,000 or more different variants of that car, then we will, that is, a lot of the technologies we have and will get, makes it possible to get completely individualized products. Is it going to be slow or fast? Half fast. But there are elements, for example personal AI and that you collect an AI when you get into a shop that guides you to something. I actually think that will go really fast within the next two to three years. We have one huge challenge that we haven't talked about so much and that is a lack of workforce. And that can be part of accelerating the development, so we have to go Gregory's way there, because we simply can't get anyone. But it can also reduce the development speed when you have someone who doesn't want to be in a store at all, and then still stands there, because that can also be clearly felt. Is it difficult or difficult to invest in this change with retail? Yes, first of all, there are many retail businesses that are listed, but there are also many start-ups that make the new radical technologies we need here. So I think there are a lot of investment opportunities. Rich, sustainable or clever? All three. Rich because it is an efficiency of society. People make better decisions. Sustainable because we can avoid waste. We only produce the amount that you actually want a market for. Who says that? The better control you have on the whole chain from the factory or where it is now produced to the consumer, the less waste there is. And smart, that was the third question you asked about. Smart in the way that we get much better advice on what we need. Let's say I'm thinking about becoming a musician and then I ask an AI, can you suggest how I to complain if I want to be a musician? Because I don't know a thing about it. Then it tells me how to do it. What kind of musician? An orchestra or a rock musician? I want to be a drummer. Supertrend? It's highly Super supertrend.

There are many climate standards that say we shouldn't build anything, we should create life in the cities we have. And these 30 million-tombs of apartments in China in these new megacities. And then the 9 million they want to build, they're building the line of peanuts, combined with 30 tons. Those who will live there, it's up to them to decide if they get blue glass in their window or something, but there are also people who have been beaten to death for complaining negatively about this. This is Supertrends, the program where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked quarter? But don't you think of people, cars, heat and life? Imagine that you have to create a new city, right in the middle of the city, where it's 40 degrees warm most of the year. Is there anything you would do differently, when you look back? In this episode, we will talk about the future city from two perspectives. From above and below and from below and up. Welcome to Supertrends. Lars, I am looking forward to hearing what you think about this. I was invited to talk about a future event in Dubai by Fast Company. And the only thing everyone wants to talk about is the The Line. This completely wild project that will be a city 170 km long, narrow, 500 meters high and 200 meters wide and without any forms of road it is completely car-free it must be CO2 neutral it must accommodate 9 million people already 5 million in 2030 and in the middle there will be a canal a canal. It doesn't take more than 20 minutes to reach the beach. So they are doing their best to make it look like a city center. But if you live in a city like Arrondissement, it's not that easy. It takes 5 minutes to get to certain activity. The last future-like thing I'll tell you, because we're looking at trends and we know how fast something new is coming, is that it's things like cash registers, so you can take out the parts and replace them with other elements. And as I said, there is a mirror all the way outside. And the dream thinking here is about nature. That you give 95% back to nature and throw people up in the sky. Wow. Wow. I'm sure there will be really exciting innovation out of such a project. It's not a place I would live because I'm a supporter of low organized chaos. That's just my opinion. This is not about my opinion, it's about the future. The SuperTrends machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, who in combination with artificial intelligence, give a signal when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. That's right, and we have many predictions that many predictions about cities and urban planning. But there are also many predictions about all kinds of technologies that we can see are relevant for urban planning. The themes that I can see across it all, I will probably read some of them up, but there is something about that transport becoming three-dimensional instead of two-dimensional, that is to say that we get vertical take-off and landing and things like that. There are some things that are driven by robots, there are already, but more and more and closer and closer to our everyday life. Then there is something about these mega-environments, as big cities are, that there are different ways of making micro-environments that fit better with people's psychology. It's something with maker spaces and micro-grids and living spaces and vertical farming and such. So it's a localization within these mega environments. And then there is something with smart surfaces, surfaces that can change from sucking heat to emitting heat. There is something with digital coating, digital wallpaper, one could say. There are solar panels that are built-in, and sound absorbing materials. And then there is something about modularity, and you mentioned it with The Line, that you can simply take modules out. A possibility is in a high house, where you say I would like to have an apartment, then it is installed in a factory and then it is driven out and then it is just driven up and pumped into a shed. I don't know if that's how it will be. And then of course there is environmental friendly, which is a huge topic overall. So if we look at some of the concrete predictions, then I would say these that these prognoses are not about when things are founded as much as when it starts to break through and become a part of people's reality. So you expect in 2024, more and more places, you will actually see what is called last mile logistics, that is the delivery all the way to where people live with robots. Small robots that run around the airport and deliver things and pick up and pack and such that. And at the same time, robots start delivering from the air, which is a complicated thing. There is no expectation that it will be huge in 2024, but it's starting to appear more and more places. We should at least start thinking about it in urban planning. And then there is a term called the 15 minute cities. That is where you can reach all your daily supplies and purchases within 15 minutes, so you don't have to have so much heavy traffic infrastructure to get back and forth. And that is what they have talked aboutments are about. Then there's something called Black Kitchens, and that's robots down there. For example, if you no longer need to use as many parking spaces because cars are self-driving, then you get some empty spaces. I think they should be made into nightclubs, but there are some who think they should be made into robot-controlled kitchens instead. It could also be fitness centers. Then we have vertical take-off and landing aircraft, so it's a manned aircraft. I can imagine that it primarily starts in the Middle East, because the Emirates are too hip to be completely open about some things. So you start to see it in practice, and that means that you have to think about where they can land. Should they be able to land in the middle of the city? It's a bit of a hassle, even though you can do a lot with it. You can, for example, make it like this, that the first 400 meters are on electricity, and then they switch to fuel. And then there are some of them that you can't hear when they are over 400 meters high. But if they land on the roof, you might have some walkways up on the roof, so people can walk to and from them. It can also have some meaning. It's a planned line, that there are different levels. 2026 is expected to have robots technically able to deliver indoors, so they can take an elevator. It's pretty cool, you get in an elevator and there are two people and a robot in there. They can get to the door and open and close with QR codes, which people may have on their phones. We have known about co-living spaces for some time, but have it really started to take hold? 2-27 is a hybrid between people having their own apartment or house, but typically an apartment in the city, and then that they at the same time live a little in a collective, so it's something that gives some social benefits, while also having the advantage of being able to go to bed without having all kinds of people around you that you don't know. And then makerspaces is a phenomenon that we have talked about a lot of places, but also workshops where people can go 3D print, for example, and do different things. So you get a revival of craftsmanship and the little put environment where people are. There are many schools that dream of having the school class and go and be together with some companies and research environments and do some practical things instead of just sitting in class. Yes, and all that is about is that we came into the industrial age, everything became standard, a lot of fabricated in large quantities and was extremely cheap and effective, but also cold. And now we are also trying some counter-movements, where we try to recreate some of the advantages of these small, narrow societies. But also something we are talking about with technologies that go across industries, so you can't just orient yourself in relation to your own business anymore. And then have 2029, when microgrids will be expanded. It is primarily based on building integrated solar panels, ceilings, walls, windows that receive some sun. That means that there will be some buildings that produce more than they can consume and then they have to sell it. And then it will be sold automatically in a very small network. And then in 2030, or 2034, you coating will be used, or it will be really passed on to climate control. That means you have an area on buildings that can change color, so they absorb, they become black when they need to attract heat. You change colors when they need to emit heat.. So that's an example of digital surfaces. So now I just mentioned the start, also digital coating, where you have a whole surface, which is actually a TV screen, and you produce already for almost no money in Asia. Tapestries, i.e. soft tapestries you can roll out. You also have the round ones. And that means that in big cities you see a lot of surfaces that are actually digital surfaces. In Verbier, where I live in the winter, there is one who is restoring a hotel for me. And they want to make a part of the surface, it's old wood, so rustic, but a part of the surface will be digital screens. So they are making something that is pretty cool while rustic. So that's what I have, and I think that many new technologies will also create a renaissance of a more decorative style. I have been to a restoration in Berlin, which was full of spires and other things. It was destroyed in the Second World War, and because people didn't have that much money, it was just a totally cash register that was built up. We found the old drawings and rebuilt it again. And with the help of 3D printing, you can make it really cheap today. And then you have to listen to our presentation and storytelling, because that's where the money is. I'll just say the last thing about it. We sold it and then asked my partner why it took so long to Saudi Arabia. When the city after the plan is ready in 2030, it is expected to become an infrastructural mega project without any advance. A long straight line consisting of two main buildings, each of which is 170 km long and 500 meters high, with about 200 m between them, which makes up the city's width. The city must be driven by sustainable energy and be totally car-free. The Lion is seen as the crown jewel in Saudi Arabia's grand attempt at transforming from an oil state to an important player in a green and technological future. And while some praise the plan for its radically innovative vision, others point to the kingdom's lack of human rights and The Lion's open potential to become the world's most effective survival project. I've been watching a lot of these gamers, and they're sitting with Roblox, and they're talking together, and they say, now we've built all these cities virtually, and when we grow up, we will of course live together and make our city together. We should not live next to neighbors we do not know. And then I supported Alminor and I supported Lars Lundby, and then I thought, God, it's him who creates it. Now it succeeds, now there is a future, now there are some who do it. It's about when you have a child, a text of village, they say, especially in our age where up to 40% live alone, then it can be insanely hard both to run a career and have children at the same time. So the idea of being serious and thinking in that village, I experienced with you, Lars Lundby. You are the founder and director of Alminor. Welcome. Thank you. You can explain how you do it, if you can quickly make an intro to this dream. You do some matchmaking. It's one of the trends Lars talked about, about localizing and getting down to scale, getting down to where we actually know each other. And I think I, like so many others, like you described, these gamers, have always dreamed of saying, why is it that we can't do it ourselves? What is it that makes us, in some way, in some of the most important things in our lives, namely our home, where we spend the most money, or at most the most money, where we actually have the least influence? There is some kind of mismatch there. So we set we are saying that something is wrong here, and we are not so many years back, maybe 50 years back, where it was very normal that the way you built, there were 10 families that came together, then they made the so-called building association or the building association, and then they built by standing on each other's shoulders, literally, in relation to credit, they helped each other with financing, typically with a local bank as an anchor. And then they built without developers, without property agents. They did what they wanted. And that we have re-invented. So what is Alminer? Alminer is a funny mix of what we could call a dating platform, group dating, that is, people who have shared dreams, who get some help with some technologies so they can find each other and say, what kind of dream do we have together to promote? And that's what I think is exciting about this, Lars, because it can be scaled because people are using some some technologies to organize their dreams and put some prices on and some decisions. Give me a case from some of the residents, because they have to make some choices. Yes, we just moved to a new village in Torgve a little while ago we moved to a new country town called Fridlev. It's a 42 family, typically from Copenhagen. It's small children, families and all sorts of others. They have been involved in designing and building, where we have taken on the front and financing. But they are actually part of the building and are involved in building it. And there is the case, I live in Vesterbro, I have two small children, I come home from my busy work and my children are lying in their beds with an iPad and watching Netflix. We can don't know what to eat, so we buy fast food. We get what's ours. We buy ourselves in. We have a family, but we're a small individual in every part of the world, serviced by the big market with Netflix and fast food. Then you look at each other and say, ah, that wasn't the life I had imagined. It's not right there. That's not what we dreamed of. I dream of something with a child. They have to play with others and jump in water puddles and climb trees. So it's about realizing that dream. How do we do that? And that's what we do. We put together a scene. We say we bring 35 families together and then the dream is concretized and built. And that's a form of, you could say, a lipphaver-boli, just for many. Lars? Do they know each other in advance? No, they don't go ahead, they meet through the platform. That's not what it is, it's actually typical. Then there are maybe three families that know each other in advance, who have had this conversation, but they then meet each other in a dating platform. Is there a kind of profiling mechanism that helps them to find a relationship? We build a lot on the same. We have used a number of technologies from the dating platform. So in the same way that the dating platform can't really get people to fall in love, but we can start the conversation on a high level. So we know we all have kids who dream about this or we all ride mountain bikes. So we start the conversation on a high level. And that makes us have a great value community from the start. What I also find interesting is that it sounds romantic and a bit boring now we have the line, which is the diametral opposite. It should cover 9 million people and then it can work as a form of ecological self-sufficiency ghetto with some community-oriented individuals who can handle it, but all the others who don't want to contribute to the community, who just want to buy in. So there's also something with whether you are a resident or a consumer. Can you... That's super important, because now you are in a trend program. But as we know from trend research, every time there are these big trends, and that is the income market, then there is a downtrend. And that's what we do. Then we come in and say, there is a niche of people who really think about something completely different and say, what about love? What about relationships? What about our lives, just life? Is there a basis for a downtrend? that's what we're doing. That's where we don't go with the big capital funds. We don't go with the big buildings, the big mega projects, the line. We go the other way around, down the small scale, where it's the citizens themselves that create and where we drive it forward from down. What I'm so excited about is one thing about theory, because I also love collectives and I love dreams. I've just been on family vacation and after three days, you say a little that it's like milk, then it gets sour, right? And then it's nice to move on to yourself again. So what is a dream to be a reality? Because economically, there is also not just a trend, but a super trend in getting further on the ladder, for example with shared cars, shared facilities, these are the megaspaces that Lars Tvede was talking about. Is it an inclusive system or a gratuitous system? Many questions. If we take a quick look at the technologies, it's completely true that if The Line and other modern companies are about making consumption a system, making it easy, not more than 5 minutes to consume, then it runs, there should be drones coming with my food, etc. Then ours is about doing something else in the system, namely the share economy, namely localized workshops, makerspaces. It's about turning the technology's purpose on its head. It's not about driving less sustainability, more consumption. It's about empowerment, about making local self-government possible. Technology plays a huge role there. It's about what purpose you put the technology for and what kind of sustainability you have when you have the power and the competence to do things. It can make spaces possible. It can share economic tools and make it possible. And there we can see research, there is a lot of research also on the European level, that communities have a very significant and really significant lower CO2 emissions. There is a significant decrease research, also on the European level, that the population has a very significant and really significant lower CO2-impact. There is a significant decrease in food waste and there is a lot of, I know you have made programs all around at some point. I think we can see that people who live in the population, they have a significantly longer life age. They have a significant decrease in pressure on the immune. They use up, when Realdania came up with some numbers on elderly communities, where they say there is seven times less pull on the public services. So it's a huge number. And then you can say we can invest in one or another solar cell technology. It's fine. We save 0.2% on CO2, we can also save 60% for your community. It's like some completely different numbers when we have that form of social economy at stake. So now The Line is actually trying to make some mini communities in Højden, so you have 5 minutes to all the places in your mini community. So the units are bigger. And when you put people to work together, you say that there should not be more people to work with than they can share two pizzas. So it's not a lot of people who can actually cope. How did you choose Scala when you designed these cities? Well, we do that very concretely by going down in Scala. We never make projects with more than 40-45 families, because there are cognitive limits for many people you can know. There is a lot of sociological research that says that around 150 people... Donbass number. You know Donbass number. Then you have to remember each other's names. If you no longer remember each other's names, what kind of relationships do we have? And what is it called, the whole paradigm, I could also read the pitches for The Line, and yes, where does it become sustainable and social, Google does not do that, because the paradigm is the opposite, the paradigm is that we become lonely, that we are serviced, that we become consumers. And therefore it is about what kind of underlying drivers that run such a project. Have you not that it will be one big global country? Exactly. And that's also very historical, that shows that it seems like some assumptions. It's bullshit, we know that. It's social washing, greenwashing, it's all the bad stuff. Because we can see that all of these megalomaniac dreams always end up in the same place. It's the rationality that drives it. Corbusier also had fantastic dreams, but what we brought into the Gellerup plan and Woltz Moes and so on, was the rational construction, the modular construction. It wasn't love and green inclusion in nature and such. It's the rationality that counts, and that's why we invest in technological things. It's the rationality that, in the long run, creates the relationship, the love, the sustainability. That's the central approach to building new cities in a more sustainable way. It's more about individualization and convenience, as you have said. But what about personal ownership? Now I imagine there is, for example, a car shop where you have access to. Do people take care of these cars when it's not really theirs? Do they experience them as theirs? We don't need to guess. We can just look at the research. There is an economist named Elinor Årstrøm, Nobel Prize winner, who has been the pioneer in what is called research in fields. And there we have a huge research base. It goes back many, many thousands of years. It's not just a guesswork right now, what through all times has created sustainable societies. And there is co-owning one of the most important things. And therefore the idea that we don't take responsibility, it is based on the fact that we are not co-owners. So all that huge megatrend with that we all just have to play things and read things, we don'tasing things and not owning anything happens, but it doesn't create greater responsibility, it doesn't create greater community. We do the opposite. We create shareholders. So it might well be that we only have six cars. Let's say we all own them together and have responsibility for each other, because then they are cool cars. What if the Crown Prince called you in the morning, Lars, and said, one of your villages doesn't want to move into our house and we will pay full rent next year and your children will learn English and get the best teachers from all over the world. Can this country be transplanted? If all the inhabitants were able to get it, would there be any way for it to become a 500 meter high building? Again, I would never underestimate the paradigm of the developers who run such a place, because the paradigm is something else. The purpose is something else. The purpose is to use, isolate and control surveillance. There are completely different purposes that drive it. So that's why we're doing something else. If the question is, can we do it in cities? Then the answer is of course yes. Of course we can do it vertically. Vertically and also with a new form of modern nature, as it should be if it is to be built vertically. In the cities we should work with a new technique to integrate nature in all possible ways, also vertically, clearly. And there are a lot of sociologists, the good old Danish Jan Gehl, who is one of the world's leading experts on this, has a lot of research where he says that as soon as we get over three floors, people will come down to the garden. And then you can say that if we want to have a green environment and meet it, we will have to move it up in those floors. So, when we work with urban projects, it's about breaking that the idea of where we meet and that we can meet at different levels. It's not just states and kingdoms that make plans for sustainable future cities. Various private individuals are also actively inviting visionary alternatives to the society's society. Here are three examples. 1. The businessman Mark Law will build a new city in the USA with the help of Bjarke Engels. The city will be called Teloza, divided into 36 mini-cities where everything is within walking distance, and the city council will work from a model he calls Equatism. It combines democracy, capitalism and socialism, including with inspiration in Denmark. 2. The musician Akon has in the past worked on a more or less imaginative vision of Akon City, which was to be located 100 km south of Senegal's capital, Dakar, and run by the crypto currency Acorn. And then there are of course three. Elon Musk stands for one of history's most megalomanic, and yet perhaps realistic, plans to build a self-sufficient city on planet Mars. Then I would like to welcome our next guest, and that is you, Morten Størup. You are an architect and also a consultant for retail. I think that's an exciting perspective and a city planner at CK & Co. Welcome. Thank you. When you plan a city, you don't know the people in the front line and often sit in a municipality or something else and are top down, you could say. I also have a dream of new immigrants and that a new life is created. What do you need to do to get out of the screen and meet? One way to do it is as we just heard. It's just very difficult with the tools we have and start to connect cities in that way. We can take hold of the tools or the elements that we have have to do well when we work with the city. In Denmark, it is a question of having a law of planning that we work within. What you may remember when we are talking about this, now we are talking about 45 families. Now you are sitting in the city center before, then it is not 45 families we are talking about. Then we are working with a city development for thousands of people, because they are already there. We may not have the luxury of planning for a small group that knows each other. So you think it's a small luxury that can't be scaled up? It's hard to scale it up, and we agree on that, I could hear, because there is a limit to how big this group can be. And then you get some other dynamics, because then we also have to answer some other questions in relation to, then it is not a question of how the internal group works now, how do the groups work compared to each other. And then we get into it, and it leads me to the fact that there is a big challenge when we make a city planning. We have a city to do and a city is simply too complex to allow one or the other or the third day order to control it all. So what do you do then? Now it's not just a small town in Jutland, it can be these big mega cities. And if we think back to when we closed our eyes and thought about Los Angeles or Paris and see all the ballads there are, because there are a lot of people who have it like Lars, who do not feel recognized, who don't feel seen. And we look out towards 2050 and think about some of these future technologies. What are some steps we can take differently? As we started with, there are a lot of new technologies that we don't really know the consequences of yet. We use them in some ways. Sometimes it's something that supports our lives, that supports our communities, even though it's happening on a screen in front of us. And sometimes it's turned the other way and used to control our lives. I was standing here thinking, well, it's really up to you. You have the huge advantage of being in a country and a society where you can actually make decisions. Some of them, we started with The Line, they don't make decisions. Those who live there, it's up to them if they get blue glass in their window or something. but there are also people who have been beaten up for complaining negatively about this. I have tried to talk to all the big planners and architects in Denmark and get them to talk about The Line. I know they that they are part of the project and that no one wants to speak out. And that's what I want to ask myself. Can you even make a city for 9 million people without making the process open and transparent so that others can come in and say, have you thought about this correctly or what about this? It depends on what you put as a value base for it, because if it is a question of making a machine that can work, so you can have people who can live there, and you can put some goods, which is the basic task and sub-structure of the city, that we are people who meet and we are people who trade. Then you can do it, but it will not be a good city. You will not thrive in that city, but the transaction that should happen between people and goods, it can work well as a machine. There are a lot of other conditions and that is what characterizes it. That is also why we're searching for the old cities. It's because it's taken a thousand years to build the rooms and the premises that make it an interesting place to be. And I think that's great, but most of us can't live in a city center like that. And one of the dreams of LINE is to give a city center to to everyone, so that it can democratize. I know that there are a lot of things to think about, especially me as a woman standing here, but now I have to speak their language. I think it's a creative thought to think, can we do it differently? Could we push all of Manhattan in, set nature free and build in height and think in small communities instead of 100% sustainable and self-caring systems? The reason they don't want to speak about it is because they write down that they want to be first. I talked to one of them. It's like when you want to build the highest building in the world, so you don't tell anyone how high it should be. And then you put an antenna on it at the end. The things you say are all the things they say in their very nice renders and pitches. And that's how it is if we look back. What is it called? Songdo, which is the first big smart city in Korea. Completely the same. It was 10-15 years old. And it's empty now. All the big cities in the world, millions of buildings, smart cities, green, fantastic communities. It's what they call ghost cities in China. And they have 30 million empty apartments in China in these new mega cities. And then the 9 million will be built by The Line and Peanuts, combined with 30 empty apartments in China in these new mega cities. And then the 9 million they want to build the line of peanuts, compared to the fact that there are 30 empty apartments in China. And all that megalomaniacal thought that the crown prince knows how the world looks like, it is so naive that it screams to the world. And you as future people should know that. It's simply the most naive idea, that a human being can figure out how the world and life is going to turn out. And something as extremely complex as the real life in real cities with real people, it's so completely crazy complex, and to think that a single megalomaniac crown prince vision can shape the future. It's just disgusting. And what they have tried to do, I will talk about the technology, I was provoked by it, and when I'm provoked by something, I say, interesting, exciting, I have to see more of that. And they have tried to turn it into a computer game. The Crown Prince loves computer games. They have put a lot of life and avatar people and different cultures. He is already out in which countries to represent. So we will make a kind of Babel Tower. I can't just stop thinking if you had all the money in the world, Morten, if you had all the money in the world... I probably shouldn't use the money. I should use the time. That's my point here. It takes some time to get the structures built up and the technologies that come in. Because what happens is that right now we are building the future. We are standing about the future. And the vision we are setting up this year does not fit. And that is the point with this. When you are working on such a large scale with cities that are so complex and take so long, then you have no chance to put this frame down. There are a lot of historical examples. You mentioned Coup de Pochette, Lars. He has driven all of Paris down in his drawings to show that if we build a lighthouse and let nature come into Paris, how fantastic it could be. It didn't happen, fortunately. Then we would have lost something else. But they have come up, either in Guilherme or in Marseille, or wherever they have come up to, in an attempt to do this. But while they have come up, the world has changed. And then they can no longer be used. And then they are starting to be empty. I would say that the Corbusier building in Marseille is still full. My father has an apartment there and it is sold for a fortune. And they are really cool that you come in. A bit like the Arne Jacobsen Hotel. Everything is thought through and everything is designed. You really get a good sense of the way they have tried to think good frames for workers. And I think that's a point, because God forbid that this tiny building was allowed to be built, and not the whole of Paris. Because visions, and that's what I think is also very important for all future and all visionary thoughts, they are an enormous source of inspiration. We also build villages on the old Garden City, which the company and Ebenezer envisioned back in the 1880s. It was also a vision that never turned into anything, but that has given enormous importance to the Danish low-rise and rural structures. So the vision is very important for very important for the progress. The catastrophe is when there is power and money behind it. Then it goes completely wrong. Are you in on that, Lars? Not necessarily. I think that sometimes good things are good with power and money, sometimes it works. The city planning in Amsterdam has these concentric channels that make it very easy to navigate in there, because you just have to look at the way they turn, then you know where the center is. It's planned and it works really well, but I could think about hearing more about, if you look at it from the top, how should we imagine urban planning in 2050? I know it's a guesswork. It depends on what kind of framework, in terms of the control forms, you work in, if Denmark wants to be Denmark, as we know it, we still have the same way of planning the city, which is largely influenced by a bottom-up approach. And if we are a dictatorship in the US, then it's a different approach. And you shouldn't take it wrong. You also mentioned it, Lars, that these big projects that you're banking through, if they're being banked through, but at least told the whole world about, they are more about setting some guidelines. And the historical examples have done that. And when we now get a The Line, it will expose some problems, it will expose some advantages that we at some point will have to react to, because is there actually something there that we can get rid of? Then we have to think about how we can implement it. Then we can consider The Line as a technology in itself that has been introduced and that we need to react to. Is it such a big success? Let's just think for fun that it is actually sustainable what is being done. Both in relation to people, but also in relation to the resource-training that is being make. And I know that there are all kinds of ways to counter-argument that part of it. But let's assume that's what happens. Then we're looking at our cities, which fill 10% of our land area. And we're lacking natural areas. Instead of looking at the land in Denmark, could we look at the suburbs and move it all into some big houses and clean our villa quarters? It's not a bottom-up solution that needs to be made. It's a top-down solution, if we were in that situation. So there is something in relation to the crises we are facing, who is it that needs to make decisions, what are the decisions. It is not necessarily a prediction from the line, but it is just to put it in perspective. Or if the oceans start to rise, and we have to move a lot of people at the same time. There are many climate predictions that say we should not build anything at all, we should create life in the cities we have. And I am very curious, now that you are also sitting with the trade cap on, what kind of thing is it that should create that life? Lars and I have one program after the other and everything is just sucked up into screens and clouds. What kind of fates are we supposed to meet in 2050? Some places it is still retail, because retail as a physical store, and especially with the development that has been since corona, where we actually found out that it is actually very cool to go down and get a in that bucket before we buy it. So there is some counter-movement at the moment. The internet trade fell for the first time last year. We have not tried that before. But there is also a new... Because at that moment we move value or save resources by moving over to the internet, by buying it that way, we also save some money. The money should be used for something else. And then we start to use it to go down to the café instead, or the restaurant, or get our hair cut an extra time, or whatever it might be. then there will be room for other types of users, which still is about the cities building a framework to exchange, so it's not just about other resources, but it's still about trade. And are we still someone who goes out in the city in 2050, or can we sit at home in the metaverse and work online? Should we even think about transport or will the hybrid lifestyle get through? I almost jumped because that's exactly what corona has shown us. We will still run out in the real world. We can't stay out and isolate ourselves and pack ourselves in. We've seen it, as I said before, on the market. It has come back to the stores. It's a huge surprise. And how do you plan your life in cities? For example, Nordhavn. On a hot summer day, it's not really to stay out and live there for those who live there. And so could say it's a success to throw a mountain out there. And other times you can't get a look in and you've placed one of the other skateparks and I have to give you and there are no people. And the only answer is that the city is complex and it's the people who use it. And then we are back to the small scale. Yes, but I completely agree. The city is a life. And you can't regard the city as such as a technology. It is a life that is lived with that complexity, like a biosystem with all kinds of interacting systems that have to find out the same. Do we get more diversity in the cities by 2050 or will we be even more ghettoized and divided if we look at Denmark? Just now I saw a number that says that almost half of Danish housing will be made into three capital funds now. And we see an extreme consolidation and industrialization of the construction industry. So it doesn't look good right now. It looks like the power is concentrated, there are bigger and bigger projects, more and fewer builders, etc. So we have to fight our little fight in the corner of our niches and show that we can actually do things differently. We can insist on love and relationships on a small scale, but it will probably be a simultaneity of more trends, I think. And you are also a bit of an upstart, four years old. What do you think about 2050? Ghetto? Diversity? Well, I would really like to have cities. When we talk about cities, Lars, you said it, it's people. That's what it's about. When we talk about diversity, it's not necessarily a question of the areas they hit. It could be that they are united, that they are the same people who build, but it's the people who live there that create that diversity. And what about all the smartness and things that communicate? We can see the flow of people, cars, movements, consumer patterns. Can you imagine that you are sitting here like gamers who can play with different things to screw up and down? Because we all think that we are completely individual, but we can see those patterns very clearly. If we look at the crystal ball, we use the knowledge we can gather to act from. So we look at the place we come from, if there is someone on the North Sea. There was no one, so I don't want to go there, so I take another place. So that's the way we can use technology. It may be relatively short-term, but that's probably where I think the influence will be the largest in our cities. I miss this kind of living-in-a-house-regulation, as Lars was also talking about. If you live that way, if you interact with other people that way, then it's sustainable for you both in terms of learning, physically, mentally and socially. Because we're super-optimized right now. Lars was also in on it. We're getting cooler and cooler and we're moving less and we're more introverted. So if someone is responsible for this, then it is probably urban planning. I think it's people who should. Themselves? Yes, and that's why my Francis Kuhle looks completely different. It's a totally empowered world where we ourselves have taken power over all this development and where we have recreated the financial system so we again own our own building process where we help each other across and where we decide how we want to live. Then there are actors like Disney and Ikea who try to build cities. Lars, can you think it through and say that the citizens should come? Again, I have no doubt that IKEA cities are the future. Of course it is. It's just logical. But it's the other one. It's a death star. Can you get the citizens to behave properly or if they want to feel like consumers because they haven't been there themselves. Of course they want to feel like consumers. That's what we do. That's the whole point. And that's also the point for IKEA, is to create more consumers. The whole The Line project is also about that. The more individual we are, the more isolated we are, the better consumers we are. And then we just have to fight for a different future, where we fight together and bang the bubbles in the schoolyard by being the three little freckles fighting together. Because the other thing, it doesn't work. Thank you both for being here. It's typically very attractive to live by the coast, or at least look at the sea. But the view of climate change and rising water levels forces us to rethink what is attractive, as well as where and how we live. Among the most prominent examples in the world right now is Indonesia's capital Jakarta, which is expected to be the world's fastest-sinkin' city. The government has therefore spent 33 billion dollars and has created a comprehensive plan to build a splendid new capital on the island of Borneo. Here, the presidential palace and most of the embassy are expected to move in soon, while the rest of the city, which is to be run by Vedvarn Energi, will be ready in 2045. Well, Lars, we talked a little about the top-down and bottom bottom up. And the line and small rural areas. So we covered a very broad spectrum and I found it very interesting. I came to think of some intellectual phenomena and also intellectual megatrends. Something I have talked about earlier is the civilisation process of technology with the origin of Elias Norbert, for example, who wrote a book in 1939 called Civilising Processes, where he writes that people have become more peaceful through centuries and Steven Pinker has invented it and I think there is also a civilizing process not only between people but also between people and technology that is to say first when we find new technologies, we throw out our enthusiasm and produce them, and there is money in them. Later we find out that there are a lot of side effects. And then slowly we get them fit in human psychology, nature and nature-friendly. And that is also the process that, among other things, is underway with urban planning. How do we get the enormous benefits at the same time, both environmental benefits, but also economic, logistical and social benefits of being many together on a small area, while we don't put the over-control that is in small societies. So it's very interesting if we can't do it alone as a newly created Taylor-Made town, Skrædersud town for 45 families out in the country, but we are also able to bring some of it into cities, if we can combine these two things. The times will show. If it is a good investment again, Lars, for our education, for our innovation. We have also talked about the cities and the hubs where the biggest development takes place. It's just because people meet each other. So if we start to design it and be able to care for it and care for the people's own role in it, then maybe it could be good to do. When I moved into my house, the mayor was very active. He said welcome and I can see you are independent. You don't want to be in this group and this group and another group. It was at least a little attempt that I didn't just move in, but that I took part in my new community. I also have a house in Lolland, and I have investigated, because it's always so crowded and bad, but there's not much more than six fireflies in a neighborhood before the magic begins to happen. So it can be done, and you should look at these people as a fantastic investment for everyone, so they should pamper themselves and be pushed forward and be allowed to fill the max, because it is just a good investment. And something else we didn't talk about, but which I also think is relevant, and that is that we should move together in the cities to make more land for nature. But there are two trends we should think about here. One is that agriculture is becoming more and more compact, and it has been for many hundreds of years. So globally, even though the world population has doubled since 1980 and we eat 30% more per capita, then we actually have, where the global agricultural areas topped in 2001 and is rapidly falling, or at least falling, and because of new technologies, we expect that they will fall very, very quickly in the second half of this century and maybe top the world's population also in the middle of this century. So there will actually be more and more free nature available. So maybe it's not something we should be so worried about. We can live in these small things out in the country, because it will be more and more empty out there. So just stay in the country. But big cities have all kinds of other advantages. Then there is of course also this thing about civilization and technology. Can we attract nature more into cities? And that is well noticed, but there are different examples in the world where people have really changed a part of a city by attracting some nature in, which just makes it feel nice to be there, and it didn't before. So there's all that we haven't talked about yet, that things get too expensive, and then you lose artists and creative soul, and then city centers die, because they close groups outside of society. And I think you could could go much more sneaky in the workshop. Yes, you can do that with zoning, planning, social housing, etc. But it's super interesting what I'm talking about here. What I could think of running the Lyn round on, Lars, is these mega cities, because it's nice that we're in Denmark and think Petit and H.C. Andersen, also a small country town, but most people live in these big cities. And I think it's super interesting what you say, I agree that childbirth has topped. But what can happen, you should hear become a thousand old, so there will be more and more people. But do you think these mega cities will be nice to have or need to have? Now the line is being built and it is planned. But is it a need to have for Saudi? No, it's not for Saudi, but all the predictions I read indicate that megacities globally will grow a lot and there is still a continuous urbanization. It will take off at some point. I think traffic technology will be a factor in that. So if you have self-driving cars and drones, it will make it more attractive for people to live further away. So there has been a pulsating movement. First it lived in the country, because that's where BNP was created with the markets. Then they moved to the cities, and because of the industry, the cars were launched, and they could move to the suburbs. Then there were self-driving cars, and they could move further away. So traffic technology is very decisive for that. And the prognoses we see are that it will be easier to transport in the future. Is it going slowly or fast with these megacities? Some of them Lars was talking about. The other Lars, there were some that just pop up like a pad here in China and Korea. Megacities are relatively predictable in terms of how things will go in the next few decades. It's not an explosive thing like artificial intelligence. The other Lars is talking about is a kind of self-organizing phenomenon that could go viral. And now I'm thinking of Burzorg, this self-organizing organization where people make home-cooking, which completely exploded, just because people liked it. So I don't want to assume that something like that can go viral in reality. Difficult or expensive to invest in? Well, you can invest your own money in buying property in one way or another, so that way it's is. There are also lots and lots of companies that you can invest in all kinds of aspects of planning, so to speak. Rich, sustainable or clever? Can we make it rich, sustainable or happy? Yes. All three? We hope so. All three. Is it a super trend, this with the city of the future? There are at least a lot of people who are burning their nails on it. Now I say super hospitals, Ørestaden. Yes. Further development of all concepts and technology within urban city planning department is definitely the Supertrends. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends.

And then, when I look at you, it tells me about all the news stories that have been about you, which are the most relevant. I think it's hard to see that we will see a lot of media shut down. It's something that smells a bit of micro-payment, you could say, or tax-meter payment for the news, but why would people pay for something they didn't get? So in that way, they can make ends meet by paying for what they get. If we could just use our time for what's important, what makes a difference. This is not the future. It's today. Now. This is Supertrends, where we research all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind a common amount of news, references, interpretation. Now, despite everything online, there is no guarantee that people will know the same side of the story. One is searching for Israel for offers on cheap plane tickets, another for a link to a ruined Palestinian district, and one links to an Israeli who is crying in grief, an American president, and so on and so forth. So our news picture is completely fragmented. And this episode is about the news media of the future. And for that we have two fantastic guests to help us. Lars, where do you get your news from? Do you read the newspapers tomorrow? Now we are in a media house that produces newspapers. I use Twitter a lot, or X as it is called now. Who I follow, it changes with time. but for example if I follow the war in Ukraine, I would rather follow some wounded soldiers and retired generals than follow some journalists, because I think it comes more from those who really know it and know it. I do it a little the same. I read newspapers, also through my husband. But what I look for is only 10%, so I'm very quick to read Financial Times and what we have at home. Because I look for what is stupid and what is transformation. I'm a future researcher, so I look very targeted. So if it's something like the royals and if Joachim needs to bring money to the USA or something, then I quickly move on. But then I look and say, okay, there's this thing that might change our way of thinking, living, feeling, and inspiring us. Then I take a picture of it and send it to you, Lars, and say, we need to have this. I've been in networks for many years, where people send things to each other. So it's people who work with the same things as me. So just like I get from you, I also get something from others. But otherwise I'm not one who really gets a lot of attention in the news. I'd rather have it a little later, where it's analysis. So I get something from Bloomberg and from various other sources. But I listen a lot to podcasts when I'm training, when I'm in transport and so on. Lex Friedman, All In and different podcasts. And there are some people who are sitting and discussing what this means. And I appreciate that a lot. And just by getting it as a podcast, I don't waste any time, you could say. Because what else could you do in a car, for car. And that was a place, as we saw it very quickly, it was these health influencers, where the Danish population, 32%, would rather follow a health influencer than look at what health authorities say. That would be only 18%. So it's also a bit interesting, exciting's interesting and exciting that you choose curators. That's what we'll talk to our guests about. Where do the news come from? Is it the media or who will create it in the future? You said curators. In, and in a way it's me myself, in a way, what I do as a curator, or my friends. And one of the things I follow is what is called citizen journalism. It's people who are not professional journalists, but who are thrown over a task, and very often do it extremely well. Sometimes to make money on it, many times it's just because they're fascinated by it. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, that in combination with artificial intelligence gives a signal when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. Part of the input to the machine is a method of generating news. We scan 5,000 different media every day. We have an algorithm that checks for 3, 3000 different search words in 30 languages. It's 15 million combinations that it checks every day. We also have something called Natural Language Processing that writes references. We keep the same with the prognoses we have on our timeline. Sometimes sometimes news comes in on our timeline, because we think this belongs at home in the hall of fame of the biggest technological breakthroughs. But now we have to look into the future. One of the news we have, which I find exciting, is that in 2025 there is an organization that has at least one million subscribers to a daily me, which automatically sums up news and feature stories about what you are interested in. And that will be driven by AI. I should say that I myself, or our supertrans, is doing a service like this, and it would like to be released in 2024, but we don't expect it to have a million users in 2024. In 2025 there is also an organization that has a dashboard where you can track public mood about a long range of major topics in reality. And this can be done by using natural language processing where you can see people's choice of words and themes. You can see how their mood is. When you listen to the spoken word, you can also hear people's attitudes about how they speak about something. An example that would be very interesting if you were looking at one right now is nuclear power in Western Europe. It seems like a big change of mood is on its way. It would be fun if there was a stock market ticker that shows day by day, hour by hour, what people in Europe think about nuclear power. It's Google Trends. They use it to show that there is a lot of search on it, and that's a sign of the growing interest. Yes, and you use it for many things. You also use it to find out, under Covid, you used it to find out where there was a outbreak, because if people start saying fever symptoms and such, then you think there is probably no Covid outbreak there. But it's more advanced if you also listen to it. So what are the actual words and themes and so on and how the voiceover. Then we have in 2026 a daily me podcast that is a lot of individualized, that is to say that you deliver news like Spotify delivers music. I myself am a big fan of Spotify and it makes playlists for me. Every day I get some playlists and it has taught me to know completely. And you want your news delivery to be like. But if I want it to be like, no matter if it's a text or a voice, it has to be adapted to how long I have and how many details I want. If I'm on my way to a meeting with someone who makes 3D printing for the food industry and I have 12 minutes to orient myself, then I might want to have a briefing paper on three pages about 3D printers. You can't read that. Watch me. But let's imagine that I'm in an airport and there are 22 minutes to boarding and then I go in and say to my app, give me a rundown of what has happened since Wednesday. It knows which topics I'm interested in, it knows I have 22 minutes and then there is a voice that in 22 minutes tells me about the news I'm interested in. And I think that's a very big topic, it's a topic you see in a lot of industries. You go from a standardized product to a lot of individualized products, where each person gets their own. The decision of the situation. Yes, and you also see it in functional food and all sorts of other places. Just don't you fall into that rabbit hole, that as I experience with Spotify, it just continues to be more and more the same. Yes, but I think, my experience with Spotify and earlier where I got music from Amazon, for example, and from Apple, that they are quite good at just throwing something in, if you like it, then you can probably like it too. I think they are very good at throwing things in, and if you like it, you will like it too. They are good at opening your eyes to other things, without wasting your time. So the year after... What year? Now we actually in 2027, then we have this interactive personal AI, which gives you the news, but with the condition that you can break it. So let's say again, I'm in the airport, 22 minutes to boarding, I have 22 minutes to tell me what happened last Wednesday, then the voice starts telling me about it. And then at some point it says something about Nvidia's chip. And then I interrupt it and say, try to tell me this chip from Nvidia, what does it mean for Intel? Should I sell my share? For example, example. And then it will go out... It probably works within what is called a wall garden of data, some data it controls. So it will leave it, and it will go out and make a normal AI query, and it can be done in a matter of seconds. And then it comes with the answer, and then I say thank you. Then it will then edit. Now I have used six minutes of the time that was left, so it just needs to rewrite how much, that is, how condensed it ends its review of the news since Wednesday. Then we have upscaling chatbots, it is also 2027 and it is's chatbots that if you get a new one... I just had to say something, because I've been subscribed to some business books for a long time, where they often have 10 points, those writers, and then I got an ultra summarized, and then I went away from it again, because I missed the soul, It's just something else to read the whole Elon Musk biography than just getting 10 points. These stories need time to work under the skin. I am a collector of society. I need to have the power to dig up knowledge. It needs to work through my head and down into my body. But it's good that you can handle bullets. No, for me it's a combination of things. I like the very deep media. I've written 18 books myself. You're good with your book. There's a nerd hidden in me. But I think that falls under what we've talked about a few times. It's a civilisation process for technologies. So there has been a civilisation process for humans for many hundreds of thousands of years, where we become more and more peaceful and better and better able to surround ourselves But when a new radical technology comes along, it responds to a new kind of technology. And then you have to learn to deal with it. And just as we have had problems with fast food and screen dependency and so on, we also have to find out how we balance the possibilities this creates, so we only get the advantages, but not the disadvantages? I was starting with upscaling chatbot, and that is the possibility that when you get a news, that the news with the same thing finds its own context. It sounds a bit silly, but it means, for example, I get a news about something that has happened and it sounds terrible, then all the people think that this is going to be worse and worse. But then with the same it goes out and grabs the context and then the long-term statistics actually show that there are fewer and fewer of these accidents, for example. And here it is where it happens. So it's simply a constructive news, we have to tell Ulrik H. Rupp. Yes, three-dimensional news, or whatever you want to call it. And then in 2028, the integration of augmented reality, also called XR, which is when you read from an e-reader, you will automatically see the text, if you want to have a visualisation of what it is. 2029 is an app that automatically integrates Google Earth with news. When you see news, it is actually part of this upscaling, then you can see exactly where this happened. For example, if there is a news about a shootout in the USA. And Google Earth is no longer Google Earth, it's also Google Insight. The map goes with you inside, so it's not just out in the street. And then there are 20-31, at least 1 million people have an app that combines citizen journalism with professional journalism completely free of charge and makes it also possible for people to exchange citizen news. And in general, it's citizen journalism. I could imagine that now you have a GoPro, at least some of them are wearing it on ski holidays, but it could well be a fixed inventory where you know that accidents can happen, on cars and other places. And as soon as something happens, it starts filming, both for insurance and for the news. Yes, and then there is a big topic, which is when you get a news, I have already talked about this, that the upscaling where the news brings its own context. But you can do that more distilled in the way you say, for example, what is the probable consequence on the financial market of this news in real time? That is, there is a news and then you see that it will probably have this effect on T-bonds, this on T-bills, this on the stock market, this on raw materials, etc. Like it can have this on the political parties. So you can have a real-time dashboard where a lot of dials that swing every time a news comes. That's super cool. It's all about if we could just use our time on what was important, that is, what makes a difference, and we don't just get filled with dust all the time. Yes. And then I'm going to end with a really disgusting one. Do you want a disgusting one? Yes, then give me a disgusting one. Yes, Adbad. So in 2045, with this augmented reality, where you have glasses, where you see what you see, but there is also a digital overlay, where you can see some supplementary information. So I look at you, Liselotte, and then at that moment I look at you, and then it tells you about all the news stories that have been about you, the most relevant or the most relevant. I used that yesterday, for our two guests. It wasn't disgusting, it was fantastic. Imagine if you come to a conference, you walk in and there are a lot of people you've never seen before. It's not so funny to be stopped for cocaine abuse in a car. No. I can see that. But then you can go in and get it wiped off, can't you? It's almost endless how you can build it up. Every time you look at a person, it recognizes this person, for example from a LinkedIn profile. And then the latest news comes in. According to Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, here are some statistics on the world population's trust in news media. Finland is 69% the country in the world where the highest percentage of the population is on the news. A sharp increase of 57% in Portugal, Kenya, Nigeria and Denmark. With only 19% of the world's country with the least news is Greece. In total, 36% of all the across all markets are a failure to the news media. I'm looking forward to welcoming you, Ida Ebensgaard. You have a long career as a journalist from the University of Southern Denmark. You have been editor-in-chief at Z-Land, foreign editor at Berlingske, and editor at DR's foreign editorial office. And now you are an AI fellow at SDU, so welcome. Thank you for having me. And you, Jan Birkemos, you have the most fantastic news articles and look at these changing media trends, which I can really recommend to listen to. And you are also a journalist by heart, so you really have your heart in this. It's clear in what you do. And I think we'll start by playing a little clip with you, where you have, can we say, deepfaked your voice? The sound revolution has been called out several times in this newsletter, but now it's happening. It's no more than three weeks since I wrote about wild developments in audio at Spotify and ChatGPT. In your newsletter you call this a sound and picture revolution. Because it's also the picture that can be translated into the world language. The Babel Tower was built in some way. It's a revolution, as I see it. Sound has been big for many years, but it has been a bit difficult to make because you have to bring people into a studio, like we are now, and then we have to stand and talk for a while. But with the new technology, which is not really brand new, but which is very, very easy to use now, we can make a clone. For example, my voice. Specifically, I would would have recorded a short speech in one minute. That would be enough for the technology to recognize my voice. After that I could make a text-to-speak. When I write my note, it is just copy-pasted into the system. I run it as a showcase with the standard settings and therefore not in the open. But if I had used a little more time, it is quite certain that I would have made it very sharp. Lars and I have just had a customer with the data center who would like to have translated all super trends into all into all languages so we could make them again. He doesn't want to pay for that anymore, because it can only be done by pressing a button. So I felt very close to the fact that it can cost some tasks. Ida, these technologies are incredibly easy to fake. We have had many different cases with people who have been deepfaked and so far they have not been completely in control. But when it comes, what will it mean for our understanding of news media? Let me tell you a little story. Recently I was at an event with a world class historian, his name is Timothy Gadsden Ash, and he is one of the biggest canonists. And I talked to him about disinformation. And he told a little story, which I think is worth telling. He had a conversation with one of his colleagues from Ukraine. They had a small digital meeting. But what he thought was one of his Ukrainian friends, colleagues, whatever it was. we didn't know exactly who it was. And he thought that it was one of the strange questions he asked. And he also speaks a little bit more Russian than he usually does. And then he got suspicious. And after 10 minutes he closed the the conversation and yes, you guessed it, it was of course a deep fake. And there are two things I draw from this story. The first is, let's finally talk about my future, but this is not the future. It is today, now, in ongoing wars. That's one thing. And the next thing is that in this case, he discovered it. He was misunderstood. Partly because of the questions he asked, but there was also something that was a little strange about it. But how long will he be misunderstood? Because I think that's a completely different question. We all get that, I get suspected of everything and I don't have any consent to anything unless there is something that is my idea. Yes, and I'm glad that we're going to have a long long long long long conversation about news media. But I have to spoil where I think we will end. You have to start with the same. We start directly in the future. Even though there are all kinds of challenges for journalism and maybe especially for news media and media as businesses, as business models, than as a service, then I see a huge opportunity for journalism. Because in a world where everything can be generated and is generated and everything can be faked and is faked and will be faked and we have seen it all the time, I can give a lot of examples if you want, there is a huge future and need, completely, completely, completely the initial, that is, in relation to what you are telling about how you use drugs, for someone who can clean up, for someone who can correct and say, this is right, friend. And I don't just put it on social media, or something I've just put my finger in the air and think is right. It is right, because I've checked it, and I have professional methods to say, this is what you can rely on. Jan, you're raising your hand. I agree fundamentally and academically that there is a need and it only gets bigger and bigger. I'm just not sure that it will be crystallized into a real need. I think there will be an insane amount of people who will have enough in the fantastic new possibilities that Lars just presented. Because it is something that on the surface looks like journalism and that is really good and that is on time, that feeds the individual with the precise needs that the person has. But that big journalistic narrative or big journalistic filters, we could also say, there are a lot of people who are not aware that they need and do not want to pay for it. So I'm not as optimistic about the future, unfortunately, as We here in the studio don't talk about whether it's good or bad, we just say interesting, exciting. I have some opinions about it. We'd like that too. But what I'm thinking about right now is, I can barely see what you're saying, because it has at least moved over with news about the Israeli conflict with Hamas, fake pictures, fake newslines, fake this and that. I also think the role of the users is quite interesting here, because they can see that when they try to share all these pictures, they have to change the A with a snap or write an X or an F, because otherwise they can see that the algorithms are simply slowing down the sharing, because it is not in the social media's tech-gigantic interest that a split picture is shared. And I would like to ask you, there are many reasons for that, but they have an algorithm that has to keep a good tone where they are. But does that hold in the future, that it is some tech giants that have to decide what to share and what not to share, and then there are some people who are constantly trying to get away with it, but are stopped as soon as the government reconsiders. Yes, it is deeply problematic from a societal perspective. It is democratic infrastructure, and also the opposite of democracy, it is infrastructure. And it is problematic that it is in the hands of a few more or less crazy people in Silicon Valley. Twitter is currently the most frightening example of it being in the hands of Elon Musk, who you could say has a lot of positive things about, but he's also crazy. I think it is fantastic. Sometimes we are tested on where the line goes when someone does crazy things. If there are no failures, we will not be smart. We think everyone behaves properly. But it is again how you look at the development from the dashboard. Lars, what are the big consequences? Yes, and I will think about this in this conversation. This with, that you have a brand and you have the confidence that this brand chooses the relevant stories and it's not fake news and it's the important people and so on. And there is a parallel to, we have had a program about fashion, the future of fashion, and there we talked about that there was a movement away from the big brands, and instead there are some influencers, and then there is an influencer who launches and promotes a product, and this product is then popular for a while, and then it's gone. And then at some point, this influencer is gone as well. So there is a battle between influencers and brands that run it. What do you think, Ida? Are they influencers or brands? Regardless of whether you're talking about influencers or your generals who are covering the Ukraine war, when you get back to it, what do you actually want? You want something that is authentic and credible. And then there is clearly a movement in that you want something that is personal. And I don't think that's accidental. We have always wanted to see a person in the eyes. It's human nature. And people like people. But I think Newton's law will break through in a world that is very technical. Because action gives reaction, as we all learned in physics lessons. And the more machines that come, the more people there is need for. And if you have to be the one who can provide critical information about society to you, Lars, or to you, Jan, or Lisa, or me, or all of you out there, then it has to be someone who can talk to me like a human being. And what we have seen news media do... The robot can do that, it can do more... Well, these robots, they have to be completely... Short anecdote, FT, Financial Times has launched a small app called FT Edit, which I can really recommend, where you can read the articles. You can do that many places today. And now I'm not a native speaker, I'm born and raised speaking English. And then some time passed, and I heard three or four articles, and I thought, there's something strange about this. She's never been cold. She's never been cold. And what struck me was how long it took before I discovered that it wasn't a human, human, but a synthetic voice. My point is that it is human, the one who can understand and speak to me. So I believe in it and that being human, the fabric of the texture of something, really, it will have a future. Like there will be a big future for the personal meeting. Would you ever, Lars, if you were to invest in something, how far are you from saying, we can't do that on screen. You have to come into my office. And it's, yes, it exists, of course. If you want to invest in a company, you want to talk to them. You have to look them in the eye. Yes, look them in the eye and see if they look nervous. If Larsen's case doesn't help, talk to the person, because he was a bit of a distance friend. When investigative grave journalists fall over explosive data leaks like Panama Papers or Pentagon Leaks, it is crucial to navigate the information quickly and effectively. But what do journalists do with 2.6 terabyte of data with files, accounts, addresses, journals and names. How can they cooperate to reveal the secrets and how do they ensure that the innocent do not get caught? According to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, ICIJ plays a central role in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Both central role. Both in uncovering connections that would previously be overlooked, following economic trends through document types and, not least, in refining storytelling to the last. Now we are going out in 2050. We are going to talk about media users, the media market, the news producers, the journalists and the content producers and not least the role of the news in society. So we are very busy. If we take the media users first, Lars, you and all everyone else, where do we get the news from in 2050? I don't agree. Are they influencers? I agree with the strength of human connection and that it's easier to relate to a person than to an institution or a brand. So it will certainly be a driver. But I'm convinced that if we look back at the history of digital development, then there was no one who could predict where we would be today 20 years ago or 27 years ago. There is always a lot of technology, and everything Lars has presented sounds plausible. We will probably get there, but it will not be what will dominate the media image or the media consumption. I don't think so. It will be for some prosumers, some people who will use it professionally. But something will happen. Some creative people will twist this in a way that it can be used in a different way. So it will be much more near-relevant and relevant for the masses. And that's what we'll see. And what that is, I don't know. And it will be masses lot, not as a lot, but as individuals. For many years, if you want to be a little rough on our own industry, Jan, news has been seen as a commodity that could be stored on some pallets and then run out in some shops that we call news media. I think we will have to approach news in a completely different way. And news, I mean very broadly, I mean the analysis you ask for, or the good experience of reading a nice interview with a person, where I think, oh, that was so cool, give me something more. I want to hear it. And to get news and journalism as a service. And service is not just based on me as a presenter, but on you all as a recipient. So the user, the future media user gets it as a service. And then I want to hear from you, or you, what kind of service do we want to have? I have four children myself, and the younger they get, the shorter their concentration level is. Because they see TikTok and two screens at the same time and they get spiked and it goes fast. I've been very frustrated about it until I got a contact lens in my eye that I couldn't get out. And then it was TikTok that saved me because Smilla showed me 22 different ways to get a pale contact lens out of my eye. So she saved my eye. Yes, that's exactly it. The attention span is a really good example of not being able to predict what's happen. I was told that the time spent on the US media, the 40 or 50 biggest media, is almost halved in just six years. From almost three minutes to half a minute, good and well. Why? And it's probably because someone has found out that we can scroll on a phone or computer without any problems. We can go on and on and on. It is an infinite amount of feed we are in. That is why we scroll like crazy and have very few seconds for everything. And I think the world will never go as slow as it does now. We think we're in a nice tempo, and someone has to pick up the kids, and who gets to read all their news? That's getting even more crazy. So when the flood that is hitting us really gets in, and we haven't seen anything yet, because now it can be generated with a click in any format, when that flood hits us, then it's about holding on. And what is it that we should actually teach our children or ourselves? Well, that's for example concentration. We should go to the neighborhood. Well, try to listen. In a world where everyone gets resumes and all the time gets input everywhere, then there are some who should read deeply. You just said that it it's a service, so it's something I ask for myself. And I would at least ask for a service that not only gave me a lot, but gave me better and had an impact on my life. So if I suddenly got a personal news agent, then I can promise that I will be in a good mood. Because then it also counts on how happy Lise Lotte was when she got a constructive news behind it. And she was also lifted a little more professional. And then she got that, wow, I had not seen that coming, which she also has a lot of hair crazy. So we can just as well risk looking back and think, hold on to the news tower we were in at the time. Imagine if we weren't smart and we were completely out of it. We are now completely out of 2050. I should also ask you, we have some completely different users at that time. Already today we have some gamers, they spend more time gaming than they do on podcasts, reading, reading and streaming. Even though they are 60. The entertainment industry is coming in. There is no doubt about it, now some in their thirties and they will continue to be gamers. So that's where they have to reach. That's fine. It's just a way to convey, if we can gamify things, fine, be my guest. The fact that it should work on an old-fashioned article, and if you can't read an article, then you're the one who's in the way. No, it's actually very much connected to service. Sometimes you'll want to get it short and say, tell me what happened in the world. It can be because you enjoy social clashes. I tried to get into a meeting and then something happened and you don't know. That's not so nice, right? But if it gets gamed, if it gets heard, if it gets popped into everything possible, if I have to have ... I will be able to make dialogues with everything, because there will be a generation of in everything. Whether it's my car, I'm talking to, it's just as much where it comes from. And if we can use the things they have learned as gamers, be my guest. That's what's important. We once did a future survey on the young people, why they don't like to read newspapers. And it was paid newspapers. We asked the young people, what do you want to do if you buy a newspaper? They said, maybe if I was on the front page every day. And now it's about me. But actually, that's what can be done, Jan. With that you can get your own voice in, you can get your own picture in. You can maybe even get to know what it means to me with this story. You can get to play the leading role in the news. But it's been a long time since we talked about remembering my circle. What does that have to do with me? You can take that to the next level. Two things to that. It's about relevance. I think technology can help us all a lot. I noticed that in this list that Lars has made, there are a lot of products that use sentiment analysis, that can measure the mood out there. And that's one of the things that human journalists are good at. Ideally, they should be able to feel what people are thinking and what angle is right in a story. And that's something that technology as a starting point has a hard time with, but I think it's good at that and it's already doing well. So I think that's it. The other thing is that it's simply forgotten. Yes, the conversational communication of news. If I wish myself on the front line, I can perhaps just live with the fact that I'm in direct contact with an avatar of the journalist who has covered a story, what it might have been, let's say the presidential election in a political party, then I can ask questions and talk to that person. And in that way I myself become the center of the prosecution. Yes, you go directly to the source. So now you have tried to beg for a little bit of it, you can say. Or at least the expert. But you are a little tired of Elon Musk earlier in the broadcast. Imagine if you had him in your pocket and you could just call him and ask him what his reasons are. He has some funny and freedom fighting reasons for not doing it for fun. To what you say about sentiment analysis and choosing the news. I have a basic core that says, there is something about the human journalist, that I have so hard to see that we can replace. Do you know what, that's what we need to do now. Is the future journalist an algorithm? That's the focus we need to reach. What is it it we need to use artificial intelligence for? Cool topic. We need to use artificial intelligence for everything. Journalism is a craft. And that's true in many ways. For those who don't know what the news is about, there are a lot of people who manually test everything in every news production today. This will be replaced by all kinds of art intelligence. And thanks for that, because there is a lot of it that is really hard work. But then there is also a point where we have to say that it can be an assistant, it can look down in large amounts of data, it can sum up, it can do all kinds of things. But there is a point where it is the human sense of the stomach or nose. The nose of the heart. The nose, yes. It's funny, isn't it? It's the technical term for it, as Jan says. It's the nose of the heart. And it's completely physical on a human being. When you're in an interview as a journalist with a politician, you get a feeling that there's something here, something that's fishy, that's not how it should be. Or when I ask here, she gets pressured. Okay, this is where we're going down. Or there are some elements that are floating around out there. I think I should have called this person. Or I just meet someone. We've all been to a birthday party and sat down with someone and then you think, wow, I didn't know that. It's actually exactly the same with the future. We also see some small signs. There is no data out there. You can't use Google Trends, you can't use anything. But suddenly you see a lady hugging her dog and fighting to get it on the plane. And then you think, okay, dog-barsel, dog-counters, dog-diddy-daddy-duddy. And it's a little snack you get, and then you think, it's going to be big. And then you've thought that thought, and then you can feed it in. And of course you can also get some things that are on the way up, like a trend meter and all that. You can get that too. But when you've first got that, it can help you a lot. And back in the day, we didn't do a lot of manual work. It can take that. It can probably help Jan with the source lies, or what? It depends on how much data it has, but I agree. When I said I was just talking about sentiment analysis, it was more to say that it's a small part of what a human journalist can do under the best circumstances. But there are many other things that Ida has done really well, such as psychology. But what we're talking about here is luxury journalism. Apart from that, there is still a a huge need to tell and consume news in the future. I think that's what people need. And I'm afraid that it won't be the luxury journalist with the good news nose that will be in the big majority like it was in the good old days when the media had monocles. Was it? It was white people. Yes, there were a lot of the old media. There were probably not many women at the time who told about anything. No, no. I think I made a sign in the air. You can't see that. Your nose should have smelled it. I know you mean it. No, it wasn't better in the old days. There were also ego chambers. What are people reading Berlin or politics or information? It's all ego chambers on the same see on all kinds of social media. So there is nothing different there. But I just think that it is a fact that the use of news from news media is decreasing. It has gone down over many years, at least the part of it that is paid for. And I can't see any reason why it shouldn't continue going down in the future. Yes, it doesn't fall. It's just our definition of what news is, has been completely changed. Because if you asked us 10 years ago about something that a retired general or an influencer said on Instagram, you wouldn't't call it news. But that's what it is today. When I look forward, I see a very strong polarization of media. If you look at the picture, there will be some very large units that are able to, and here you have to think about language, is holding up with a barrier. So it could well be The Guardian or The New York Times. Now you jump to the next topic. Journalistic genres are constantly moving and affected by technological development. In our time, the newer genres, for example drone journalism, with coverage of events with drone technology, constructive journalism, which is solution-oriented, and sensory journalism, which is adapted to capture the attention of users with a low level of concentration. In the future, there will probably be even more technologically advanced genres, such as adaptive journalism, with articles that automatically adapt to the user's previous knowledge, interests or even mood. Climate journalism, which shows the opportunity's positive impact We also need to talk about the media market. Can you make money from these news in the future? This is also an investment program. What will the business model be? Will the politics of the Berlingske Tider and the New York Times exist at all in 2050? And then I would also like to hear from you, which media do you see that gives us a little hint of the future already now in the big world? Just to get the argument through here, I think there will be an extreme polarization. There will be a few media houses that are able to have a critical mass, to have a huge machine running, which can then distribute its content to 77 different shelves, fields, target groups, sound, game, all kinds of different things. And then there will be, and they will dominate a lot, and I think it's hard to see a lot of media closing down during this process, and also national media. And there will be a huge undercurrent of podcasts and people who make programs. Oh, there are still 20-50. And you know why? Because telling stories is so fundamentally human. That's why people are involved in journalism, even though it's a business. It's in many ways a zone-out-of-the-box industry, if you look at the business model. But we can do it, because there is a drive towards the news and the story. What do you think? I agree with that, and I think that podcasts are one of the strongest formats, because they are people who hopefully have a good conversation. In terms of business model, I could... It's not the business model we see today, or the business models we know today. They are already struggling, they are having a hard time. And in the future, when everything will be turned upside down, or thrown into the air, and we don't know where it will land, it will be something new. One possible, I'm not saying it will be like be, but it could be a plausible way to go, is to use the same model, the currency that is behind the transactions that happen when you make artificial intelligence, which is paid with tokens. Every time you send a task to ChatGPT, it costs some tokens in a service center. You could give a factor, a calculation factor, so that the government, or whoever it was, 24-7, got 0.5% of the trade, if you made a conversational story. It smells of micro-payment or taxameter payment for the news, but on the other hand, it's also very rare. Why would people pay for something they didn't get? So they can make money off what they get. It's the synergy between someone who scrapes the market for the stories there are and someone who has to pay for the quality journalism that it should not go to waste. So that's the whole debate. It's very current. But how does it look against 2050? Have everyone given up and put everything in? Or have walls been built up against the artificial intelligence of some media houses that insist on intellectual property? Or is it a big flow? What do you think, Jan? It will come to a close. It is simply necessary. Those who will not be involved in the collapse will disappear. How they will be rewarded, they are rewarded, because you need money for your work, it's up to you. It's difficult, but there's a general dependence, because the big language models depend on being trained on quality material. If the media doesn't produce quality material, they need to earn money,, but they will also have to pay for it. So it will go back and forth, and those who haven't been involved will be gone. And then there are a lot of local news out there, and that's a completely different thing. Because it might be that we can translate everything into the world language, but do we want to hear about the others in it? Peter Plys says, it's about time Peter Plys comes into this program, I can feel it, says very famous that when he is asked if he wants to hear a story, he says, what it should be about, he says, I would rather hear a story about myself. And then the cuckoo gets a story about himself. And that's how we humans are. And you can say that it's egocentric and all that, but the fact is that sometimes I think, if I have to be a little harsh on my own industry again, that there is a tendency to beep and say, it's too bad that people don't want to pay for journalism. No, but you know what? You haven't made a product that is good enough for me to find value in it. So if you now made a product that was good, then it could well be that I wanted to pay. I can understand someone who is 25 years old, who looks at certain parts of the media industry and thinks, hold on, I just paid 40 kroner for an article in 7-Eleven. And got in a bad mood. Yes, and got in a bad mood. I simply don't believe that. And then the other thing, we must be happy about, is that there are public service or state-funded media. You can call that ideological, but it's not good. You're up front again. The fourth state market is the fourth and last point we need to look at towards 2050. Will our level of education and knowledge be raised to new heights? We have never been smarter, we have never been better informed, or do we end up with a discount fast food model, where we are driven around in a Ménage as a little hamster. What do you say, Jan? There is no guarantee that you will become smarter because you are bombarded with information. On the contrary, you can probably be very, very confused. And I believe that if you want to be smarter, you also need to have the ability to concentrate and you need to have something to concentrate on, like reading a book or reading a longer article or seeing a documentary. So if the market both offers that, but also that there is a mood and a time and an economy to consume it, then it may well be that we become smarter because we have the principle of the possibilities to get the information also in real time and quickly get them converted to what is relevant for one whether it is to buy, sell stocks or whether it is something else. It's so individual, but it's a difficult question. To be honest, this is not about the media, it's about where the society is on its way. And there you can say that there are some other programs we have, among others from Taiwan and all kinds of other countries, where democracy is so much believed. So that's also where the fourth state power comes in. I remember working with these newspapers, and then there was one who said, if the young people don't read the newspapers, they should lose their right to vote. But how and how capable are we to participate as active citizens in society? I think that is one of the core values that journalism should create. So do we get a common image of news, of quality, of how things are connected, or do we get that extreme fragmentation with an infinite number of individualized images, depending on where we stand in it? I think you have understood something completely central here. I don't see any contradiction between the fragmented image and the big conversation. That's how it is. I have my life, and it's different from yours and it's different from someone who lives in Jørgenslev. And we see some things. It does not prevent us from having a joint conversation about that there should be a referendum. When that is said, I think we need a education project at the level of the Grundtvig & Højskole movement. And the core of that education project, which must be rolled out, must be the basic critical sense. To strengthen it. And critical sense in all possible ways. Partly it is right, but also what am I standing for? What am I supposed to do? Totally agree. And you can see that all the democracies around the world, that are transforming into autocracies, there is something of the first that happens, it is that the free press dies or disappears. So if something responsible had to happened in our part of the world or in the whole world, then it goes the wrong way. So that's why I hope and believe somewhere that you are right in that of course there will be a question after a joint conversation, which we need to have. And that's the most exciting part. Unfortunately, we have to wrap up. I could go on for much longer, but I would like to end with a short question for both of you. We are now in 2050. What has most disrupted us? You may remember when Nokia was taken over by smartphones, and you thought, hold on, will it be on the tech side, which it seems a bit like when we listen to Lars, or will it be on the content side, that we come back and say, there were some crazy things there. And what surprised us the most? You are in doubt the middle of nowhere. Jan? I think we could again conclude that we haven't seen that before. And it's the culture. It's not about tech, it's not about politics, it's not about the media. It's our human culture that will control it. There's a dimple that we don't know yet. Okay, I don't believe in DIMS. I think DIMS is gone. I think we should look back and think that we should use all this technology. It flows into some other types of... away with screens and DIMS. And then it will be a understanding that it is me who uses it, who should be the driving force in it. And it's not a trick, because I am also a citizen in society. Thank you very much for being with us. Lars, with these interesting guests, we have to jump directly into the limelight. Are these news media nice to have or need to have in relation to democracy? It's need to have. It's essential that we get better and better news. And now we call it news, it's also analysis and understanding and all kinds of sources of insight. We've seen a lot of examples of democracies that become failed states because people are not intelligent enough to choose some reasonable people to run their country. Is it going slowly or fast in relation to the way we usually do things? I think it's a paradox when you talk to these journalists. They know everything, and yet they can't take their own medicine and walk the walk. What's wrong? So are consultants. But this is one of them that goes really fast. It's happening right now and it's happening exponentially. Is it difficult or difficult to invest in these new media? I tried to get some new ideas out of them, but it was a bit difficult to get some specific ones out, I think. There are many ways to invest in it. First of all, there are many people who make a personal media product, for example Lex Friedman, who is just a person from MIT who has had millions and millions of followers. And today you see relatively many cases where individuals have more followers and more news flow than large established media brands. They just can't know everything about everything, Lars. No, but it just means that there are huge opportunities to start new media productions in all kinds of formats. And in general, I would say, in turn, and invest in it, that companies also have communication departments, and there are some companies that are very good at grasping these technologies and then spend really good media in front of what they are doing to attract their core business. So in that way you can also look at who is good at using this and who may be hit by it. Is it Amazon, Google that are sitting on the bar in the future or who is running the bar? They have some huge business franchises. They can talk more and more about news and they want that. And Facebook, Meta and so on, they have network effects and then it gets really, really big. They are algorithms themselves. You just have to say that the technology to do this, it falls pretty close to nothing. Every person can buy professional studio equipment for almost nothing and just get started. So there are lots of places where we want to see new companies and new business models on it. Rich, sustainable or smart? It's definitely smart. I also think it's a step forward for the development of well-being in the world, that people are better informed. I mean, it's a step forward. And I don't know if it's sustainable, because there are a lot of servers that are cooking to get this done. It's better than bitcoins. Should we give it a fanfare? We should, to a large extent.

The theory and the methods have been there for many years. But there has been a breakthrough. At the moment we have children who are being completely disliked. And if they could read each other's thoughts, they would find out that they were confused. So it's also a lot about who should have access. If the system suddenly knows something, has access. I'm very proud that you're ending the program with recommendations to criminals. It's a whole new breakthrough for us, Liselotte. This is Supertrends. The program where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrends, Lars Tvede. Welcome to the future. Imagine if you had an appointment with your girlfriend. In the evening we will have an hour where we can freely read each other's thoughts. Just in relation to some of the questions we go and talk about. Is it to smile easily or is it running cold down your back? Thought reading is a wild future subject that today's guest, tech investor and entrepreneur Sune Alstrup will tell us more about in a moment. Welcome to Supertrends, where this time we will see how we can communicate only with the power of thought in the future. Lars, some time ago a swindler started and he said he was awake and his house was on fire and he took his computer and some important parts of his body and he ran out of the window with these things. He didn't think about having a pacemaker. So his cardiologist came and said, I have data from your pacemaker that shows that you have not been stressed at all at any time. So I can't get that to match your story. So he was busted for that. And if we think about that with mind technology interfaces, then it might become a future way to clarify violations. You might even be able to rewind the time and say, right there, I would like to have the right to investigate what you were thinking. You are absolutely right. And speaking of clarifying prohibitions by looking at physiological indications, I have seen a documentary on Netflix called Killer Inside the Mind of Oron Hernandez, which's fascinating and very moving. It's about a very successful NFL star, a total elite sportsperson with a fantastic career and a good private life. It starts to down and bark for him he commits murder he is imprisoned he commits suicide in prison and in this broadcast there is a mixture of of course sports interviews you see all his successes but you also see what happens in the court you, you see different interviews from him, but there are some phone calls and so on. And what happens is that after he is dead, his brain is examined and then it turns out that he has serious brain damage from this sport. So he has a completely different... I've seen it, I've seen it. You've seen it. Yes. Isn't it right that it's moving? And it's also interesting because... But it's also because he actually helps all kinds of others who have been hurt. You forgot to say it's a documentary. Yes, it's a documentary film. And I meant it. I said it. No, I was listening as if it was some kind of sci-fi. But anyway, it raises the question of how many of those who are are in reality brain damaged and can't really do anything about it. But I can't stop thinking about it. Imagine you enter a workshop with your car and you say, my car sounds like a sick camel. It says clunk, clunk, and it loses traction. Then the mechanics walk around the car, can you describe the sounds better? Then they discuss and rub the car over the cooler helmet and so on. Then they say, ah, Monique, it's like that. But they open the cooler helmet at no time and investigate what is actually happening inside the engine. Sometimes in psychiatry and psychology we are like this, that there is something mechanical wrong, there is something biochemical wrong, there are some parts that are damaged, some parts that are missing, some some parts may have an unusual structure that can explain things. And that's what we, among other things, I think I should talk about today. What is it that happens physically inside the brain? I have been to a medical museum, and there you actually sometimes in people's brain cells if they behave too much and then you put on that there was some pressure that went from the system. But this with neurotechnology, it has actually now become an industry of 33 billion US. And it just gets wilder and wilder. Shall we look at the timeline? Yes, let's do it. The SuperTrends machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, who in combination with artificial intelligence, gives a signal when at when future groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. It is like this with our timeline, that very often there has been research and experiments in laboratories for a long time before things reach and become mainstream in the market. So what we are talking about in this timeline is when things start to really get practical importance. And of course it is qualified guess, but it is guess. So 2027, which is not that far away, there will be a big breakthrough in what is called targeted brain stimulation, which means that you can stimulate parts of the brain to achieve something. Then there is Elon Musk's company and various others, they work on brain computer interfaces and they completed some of it. There is a GET on it, it's 2030 when they start using it. And then the same year, they plan to have direct communication between personal intelligence and artificial intelligence. Which of course course interesting, because at that point one also estimates that artificial intelligence is on a level with personal intelligence. In fact, there is a consensus on the fact that general artificial intelligence is only functioning in 2030. That means you can't know the difference in the capability of a human and a computer, you can't tell the difference between them. So it can of course be interesting if you can make a pretty smooth interface between the two. We know that athletes make all kinds of extreme crunch swings to get a mile better than their competitors. Some people think that more than 10% of athletes use neurotechnology and brain computer interfaces to help themselves to get better at their sport at that time. Is it something like, you can do it, you can do it, you can do it? I think it's much more than that. But then there is one here, which sounds speculative, it is that musicians can create music simply by transferring it from their brain. And I would reject that as very speculative until I come to think that recently you have had patients under an operation to listen to Pink Floyd and then you could read from their brain that when they listen to The Wall, you can actually play it back from the side, but you can actually read it from their brain, that means you can pull music out of a brain in that way. I should also tell you that MIT is also working on a glove that reads when you start to go into that dream phase. And then it's something like Inception. It can help you not to have a nightmare. It collects both what you dream and then it actually directs you to another place. And we use a third of our lives to sleep. So it's pretty fantastic. And I think it's very interesting that it's MIT, because then you're lying there completely sleep-free and think you're sleeping, and then you wake up like a different person than when you went to bed. Hmm. Well, then there are some people who think they can make a thought transfer, and because I'm super conservative in terms of science and stuff, I don't think so. But there are something called mirror neurons, which makes us able to feel what other people feel, without being particularly aware of how it happens. But in 2032, some say, we are able to make brain-to-brain communication, that is, that you can simply transfer thoughts from one to the other. So now I'm just saying something stupid, maybe, but I'm thinking of Pink Floyd's The Wall, and then you can hear it in your head, because it comes from your head to yours. More practical, Alzheimer's disease, you might think... Can I choose not to listen to your song? I have a really good taste in music, so you should just jump on it. So in 2040, there are some who expect that you can use this really actively to treat Alzheimer's, which is a big and growing problem. And 2043 also to schizophrenia. It must be something where you replace the most insane places with some artificial thought works instead. So you imagine that if there are some holes that need to, then you can cover the rest with some kind of art recognition. I have a description of it in front of me, but I would rather hear it from our guest. But 2043, the same year, there is a suggestion that you can have a wearable brain computer interface, something you can take on your head that can help you with mental health. And it can be phobias and anxiety and all kinds of other things that are more or less serious. I think that should be the last thing I say, because it gets more and more sad when we get further out. Yes, we stop there. I think about what he can pass on his thoughts for the future, but we can ask our guests that. There is a message here, I don't want to read it, but in 2053 you can upload your mind on a computer. That's it. It will be really interesting to go to a prehistoric museum. The artist Neil Harbinson was called the world's first cyborg after he got a brain implant in the form of an antenna that made him able to hear colors. His bold step into the cyborg world led him to others who wanted to experiment with biohacking, and suddenly it was only the imagination that set the limits for the optimization of our sense apparatus. Not least with inspiration from animal husbandry. Just imagine a future where you can optimize yourself for a life with, for example, increased toxins like yeast, so you can discover and avoid toxins in the air or in yourrup. You are a tech investor and entrepreneur. You sold the company The iTribe. I'm thinking about it, Sune. What kind of guidance have people and companies had from, for example, iTracking? In a way, it like a forerunner or a starting point of thought reading. You can't look at something without having the brain power. No, there are many old words about the eye is the mirror of the soul, so there is access to what we think through the eyes. Eye tracking is not a new method, it is not something we had invented. It was simply an optimization of the method that already existed. It has existed for many years, it has been used by the disabled, it has been used in the defence of Jægerfly for example. What we did in our company at that time was that we did it in a price-friendly way, so we made it so that it could be owned by every person. So instead of a system that cost 200.000 kroner if you were disabled, then you could come down and be something you could have in your mobile phone, so it didn't cost extra compared to what the phone did. The reason I got your attention, I have to say, was thanks to a Frenchman called Sid, who has founded NextMind, and it has now been sold to Snapchat, so he doesn't want to talk about anything. So I'm really happy that you can tell us a little bit about what these drivers are behind thought reading. Well, you could say that eye tracking is a way to get our computers, phones, cars or whatever it is, to better understand our intentions as users of a system or a computer. Then brain computer interfaces is something that makes it even more frictionless to use a computer, for example, or a device. It is today, if it's our phones. But it could also be our home or our car or whatever we now have as electronic devices. Yes, because those 10 pulses we have on our hands, they are enormously slow. And we are already seeing on these chatbots that they make up almost 90% of the communication simply because the frictionless society is a huge driving force and the next step is to use the power of thought. Yes, you can say that. It is the easiest way. If a computer understands your thoughts and intentions without you having to do anything. You don't even have to look at it to understand it. You can do everything as if you were a superhuman, if we think of the ultimate form of a brain-computer interface. And when we see autistic or paralyzed people, we suddenly get a word for it. Yes, and they have also used all kinds of other means of help. If you have had ALS and been paralyzed, and the only thing you could move were your eyes, then you have had all kinds of aids. In the old days, it was just a blink was two blinks. There were many basic methods. An eye tracker could do it, so you look at letters using predictive staining, then you can also look at words, and it can go pretty fast with an eye tracker or an eye control unit. But if it's a brain computer interface, you can do it with even greater speed, because potentially you could have a system that reads your thoughts and says the computer is in just as high speed as you think it is. So there is no friction, even if you are handicapped or have had a disease like ALS. It is interesting to see that the area that has taken it the fastest is the gamers. They love it. Yes, and that is always when there is new technology. That's also a reason why gamers, like athletes, their performance and the milliseconds that determine if you're the best gamer. And if you have technology that helps you, whether it's an eye tracker or a brain computer interface, then you have better abilities in the game you play. But besides that, these technologies can also provide a completely different experience. So when you are in this gaming experience, you will be more absorbed by the experience if you feel that the system understands completely what you are doing. If I want to shoot a enemy, and the only thing I need to do is to think that I want to shoot them and with a weapon in the game, just shoot them in the split second. Then it gives a magical feeling and it really gets you hooked. It's an immersive experience, as you would call it, in a game. And that gives some magic to the game and therefore it becomes much cooler to play a game that has that kind of interface. So that's also an important point, why it's always the gamers. And then there are also just gadget freaks, many gamers, so they would like to have an eye tracker, a brain computer interface and all kinds of other things. It's also where you've always sold very advanced mouse and keyboard and joypads to gamers. It's interesting because it was gaming that made graphics chips so cheap and so fast. But then you found out that it was graphics chips that could make AI work. Gamers do something good for the world. But if I am a gamer and I want to control a computer with my thoughts, I would probably go crazy at first. I'm not used to controlling my thoughts. So how do I think about will use a computer to capture something? It's a question of how you shape the interface, and it's still something that's very early. There are very few games that are shown with the help of a brain computer interface, because there is not so much technology available. But you mentioned NextMind before. One of the things they have demonstrated over the last few years is that you can play a game, for example in virtual reality, where you have an experience of shooting your enemies by focusing on one of them. So by thinking that you are going to shoot this enemy, you shoot. And if you want to teleport somewhere, you can look at a portal in this game, and when you focus on it, you will be teleported somewhere else. It gives you a feeling that you have Jedi powers. That's just the way the game is built. The interface is made so simple, so you don't have to think about it. Just like a touch screen, when you held it in your hand for the first time, it made sense how you navigated around. It wasn't that hard to use an iPad or an iPhone the first time you got it in your hands. It doesn't matter what the first step is, we think about it. But can you try to explain a little bit about how these technologies work? Because there are some different ways to do it. Yes, there are of course several different ways to solve this, and it is still not, you could say, there is not a winner yet on this market, so you don't know 100% how an inlet product will look. But the way a brain computer interface works is that there is a sensor. The sensor can be a small box you put on the head. And then it has a comb that goes in and touches your head. And through these sensors you can simply receive some of the electrical signals in the brain. There are also other ways to do it, like Elon Musk's Neuralink. The way they do it is by inoperating. They drill a hole in the crane and then inoperate it to get direct access to the brain. So they have a better signal from the start than those who do it from the outside. Then you have to drill a hole in the brain. We have just had a microchip recording and they become very small and very light to in operate on. So it might be better. Yes, but one of the things, besides that not many want to use the hole in the skull, so some of what they write is that they expect the signal to be weaker over time if there is such an inoperated one. Because the brain, I don't want to make any kind of wave around the chip. I don't know, but it's probably quite marginal, and it's probably more for people who have extremely serious diseases. But you can say, there are different approaches, but no matter what, there must be a sensor that receives signals. And these signals have to be treated with software, where there will be machine learning, artificial intelligence. And we have computers today, but if we imagine that the way they can handle it in the future will be more effective. That means that in addition to working with signal quality, which is on the sensor, how do we draw these brain waves in a good way, then we also work on how to decode, how precisely can we decode these signals from the brain. And the more computer power we have in the future, the easier it becomes for us to understand and recognize this, because deep down what we extract is just a lot of dust, a lot of electrical impulses from the brain. Yes, because it needs to be calibrated, and today reading takes an hour. You can't read your brain zone and then say, then you have also read Lars' brain. We are completely unique in our brain waves and patterns, so they need to be calibrated to ourselves. It needs to be calibrated, just like when you say calibration, you can say a way to understand it easily is this with if you get a new iPhone, then you also need to calibrate this login, Face ID login, you need to calibrate by turning your head. And the same thing you should do if you install a Brain Computer Interface, then you have to look at something on the screen while you focus on it with your thoughts, and then the system will calibrate. But I would say it doesn't have to take an hour. A system like the ones on the market, for example, the one you mentioned from NextMind, it takes maybe 45 seconds for a calibration. So it doesn't have to be more than that. And of course, the more the method, the less it requires calibration, the faster it goes. And I would say that's exactly what I think will be on the fly the day the technology is ready for the market. I know that it's not only the gamers, but also the military that could think of pushing the trigger a little faster than the enemy. I would like you to give me some use cases. When and where do you think, apart from the gamers, you are talking about identification? Is it designed to change our way of using the drop midID and brain calibration? Or where do you think we will quickly get to? One thing is that it is easy to understand where it can be used. It could be through authentication or login, as a replacement for a name ID, where it might be safer, but still easier. But that's also more of an illustrative example, because if we take a name ID as an example, then you can imagine that you can think of something. It could be Pink Floyd to the wall. You know that if you think about it, you will be locked in. But it's not difficult. But not by opening the door. There is a person who says open the door, open the door. You say, I must't have to think about Pink Floyd the wall. I don't have to think about Pink Floyd the wall. And then he opens the door. But that's where it gets interesting. Because if there is a guy who forces you to do something, what is interesting in a brain computer interview is that it can also decode maybe some, or if you are other sensors, it can decode if you are under pressure. If you are in a situation where you have fear, you can also make sure that it closes down. There are a lot of considerations about this, but I think the reason I said it was an illustrative example is because as it is today, and will be some time in the future, a brain-computer interface requires that you have a sensor on your head. That means it's more illustrative than a practical example. We don't get 5 million people in Denmark or 6 million people in the morning to replace their midi-day with a sensor on their head. And we don't do that in 2030 or 2035 for that matter. So it's more to understand it. On the other hand, there are some use scenarios where we have a easier way to have a sensor on the head. For example, we are sitting in a car, it can be built into a headrest. It could be a glasses, the sensor can be built into the glasses. It could be a helmet. The first places be a virtual reality headset. You already have these headsets on your head. You can have the sensor on your head without needing an extra device. In that scenario you could use it, but it could also be a day to day scenario like a car where it is built in the seat. I am dying to understand how it actually does it. It should be able to with high precision in three dimensions where there is electrical activity. It is a complicated picture to find. What kind of sensors can do it without stirring your brain? I could imagine it not sending anything into the brain, it could only observe. There are many different types of systems, but if we talk about a system as a classic brain computer interface, it reads out the electrical impulses. If we take an example of a system, as we have talked about a few times now, NextMind, to describe it. You place it on the back of the head. There is a small pad, a pad, where you can also have it mounted on a helmet or a headset or a cap. Is it an advantage to be bald? It is actually yes. If you have very thick hair, it can be a problem. But it is not necessary. It reads the signals in the visual cortex. The visual cortex is one place where you can do a brain computer interface, but there are also other places in the brain, and different places in the brain require different placement. So if you for example want to decode audio, or if you want to decode audio or movement, it's a different sensor. If you want to have the emotional. There are different centers in the brain, and you need to place the sensor somewhere else. But if it's in the visual cortex, you can decode what you have seen. That is why the first brain-computer interfaces that are on the market now, that work in what we would call real time, that is, you can look at an object and then you can decide to shoot a enemy or activate it. It runs through the visual cortex, because then you can have something on the screen that is represented in your visual cortex, because you focus on it. So if I look at a screen in front of me, it will be represented in my visual cortex, and it is represented by some electrical signals. And if you have some machine learning, then you can actually decode the same electrical impulses or signals as I'm looking at. And that's what you actually do. But it's complicated, so if you have... The way they work today is typically that there a pattern on the screen that you can easily decode. So it can't be anything. I can't just look at the sky, there has to be something on the screen. Because when they do it on the screen in a game for example, there is a little marker on the enemy that you want to shoot, and that marker can be read in the brain. So it's like step one of the technology, because it's not... There are big hopes. I'm convinced that I know what the answer to my question is now. I just have to be sure. It's electromagnetic. We're talking about electrical signals in the nerve cells in the brain. And electrical signals always emit magnetic fields. And the magnetic fields are read in principle in the same way as a radio receiver. The technology we use typically is what we call EEG, which is the method we use to read the data. But it is electromagnetic? Yes, electromagnetic. There are different ways to use it if you want to create a brain-computer interface. One way is to read directly on the brain. The other way is for example, let's say you want to be able to... Another company I have invested in for example, they are doing something where you want to you want to get people to walk that can't walk because of a handicap, for example. There can be something wrong with the foot, there is something wrong with the signals down to the foot. Then you can do it that you can instead of reading on the brain, then you read instead of the muscles' electrical impulses. So when the brain sends signals to the foot or the leg, that it needs to move, you can read it. And that's what's called EMG. So you read the signals and then you can stimulate the muscles to move as your brain would like to have. Fast, Lars, because we're going out in 20.50. Yes, very fast. There is a huge electromagnetic noise in our environment from Wi-Fi and mobile phones and so on. But it is of course different frequency and maybe it has isolated itself from what comes out and only points one of them. The big challenge here is noise. There is a lot of noise. And if you are in a... You can say that the earlier versions are something like this. If you go into a mass center to show your demo, then sometimes it fails. There are several digital helmets and brain implants under development right now, which hope to cure the ever- will cure neurological diseases through brain-computer interfaces. To make the technology work, it must first collect a sea of data that gives an intimate picture of your unique brain activity. But imagine if this data got lost in the wrong hands. Now I know that some of you listeners are also shaking your pants, and you are out discussing with these thought-reading tools whether you should give the citizens some rights on the front lines. Sune, there is talk about the right to a mental private life, protection against personality changing manipulations, so I can't go in and make Lars the one I would like even better. And then you have protected will and decision making, for example against something like inception, if we start to be able to incept people's dreams. And then there is another one I also find exciting, and this is about the right access to mental improvement, because that's what we can do, and we also hear you talk about, if we are directly connected to some form of artificial intelligence and get, I don't know how many IQ points in the hat, in relation to an ecological person who is not lifted, then we really get a two-part in the population. So that's some of the decisions. How do you act in a room where you are just happy with some technology? I think that there will be, just like with the Brain Computer Interfaces, there are a lot of ethical challenges. And I have absolutely not answered how to solve them, but I recognize that there is a lot of work to do here. My focus is often on where to use use it and what are the best applications. And when you have found them, it is also easier to find out where to set the limits for how it is used. And so it has also been historically. So it was also with eye tracking. There were lots of people who were also nervous about how it could be used. And it typically also finds a game when you have found out where you want to use this technology. But the history also shows examples where new technology has been used in very negative ways. You just mentioned nuclear power before. You can say it's a super technology for some things, but it can be used in a very negative way. And that's how it will be with most new technologies. And I think it's extremely important that there is focus from the start, like here, to create some ethical guidelines. And you don't know that beforehand, before you have found out how the optimal application of technology is. So we have to let a few people get hurt. I imagine, at least I don't know if you can imagine these future user cases, but when Gallup calls and asks me about which politician, that's one of those things where you always lie. If you think some unpopular politicians in the population, then people can find a way to say another candidate than they think. And then the thought reading will call it and give the right answer. Or sometimes they get called up and asked how much sugar and sugar you eat, so you can hold it against how much sugar and sugar is sold a year and then it's completely wrong. I don't know. And also what would it do if we get a new hippie age where we can read each other's thoughts. At the moment we have children who are completely disliked because they on TikTok and Insta see others who look like they have the perfect life. And if they could read each other's thoughts, they would find out that they were confused and sad. What do you think, Sune? It really opens up a crazy box. Yes, in any case, you can say this about if your device, what format it is in, if it can solve your emotional state and you actually give permission to the system to show the honest version instead of happy face Instagram every day, then it really puts things in perspective anyway. there you also have to get into the privacy discussion. Who would you allow, for example, if my system shared my emotional state, who would I want to share it with? I might want to share it with my wife, maybe with some of my children, but maybe not all of my children. I'm not interested in my youngest child being aware that I'm in a really bad mood today. Maybe. So it's also a lot about who should have access to the system. If you suddenly knows something, who has access to it? And then we're talking about feelings here. And the question is whether you can give each other a emotional hug, whether I can think, oh, here is a big warm hug for me, and you will be able to feel it. If we can send feelings, not just thoughts. I think it's a natural development of what we've seen back from Smiley. When he was invented, they have done it now. Now you can animate Smiley and you can actually represent it with an avatar that reacts and that would be an extension of that. Especially if the systems goes completely without us having to do anything, but the system just recognizes that I want to send a cram and the system recognizes who I want to send it to. I can't stop thinking that I have been given a thought-bubble. Right now I don't think that you could read all my thoughts, but for example, some innovation projects, Lars, that everyone just sends their thoughts in. If you could imagine a third, a mixed thought pot, or I don't know, it's hard to come to terms normally. We have to choose and talk one at a time, but we can all think about how we want to solve a project. And would we also have an AI around the table and then there would be a synthesis of everyone's opinions? How would such a groupware work? I think that what you're talking about, a superhuman implication of this. Especially if we interface our thoughts with artificial intelligence, then some people will be able to get something completely extreme out of their own abilities. But I think that's the most exciting scenario I've ever seen. We've been through an age of information, where all the information that was in the world has been digitized and is now online. So the information at your fingertips problem is that it takes a lot of time to get an overview. Even with Google and other search tools, it is still completely unskilled to find information. We have now got some tools with artificial intelligence and tools like Chat, GPT and similar that can actually help us to search information out of this quickly and if we then connect it with the fact that it is frictionless to communicate for us as a human being with an artificial intelligence and the information of the world that is available online, then you have a super human being. But if you then connect it to a crowd sourced problem solving, if you put the smartest people in the world together with these supercomputers and get it connected to a single interface, I think that would be the ultimate scenario for the brain-computer interface, how it can be used, then you could solve problems, world problems, in a community, in real time, with a completely different speed. And the artificial intelligence can help send information to the right places. You should probably get a... Lars, I want to hear from you. What do you get back? It's about... Can you transfer experience, for example? So I can somehow give you all my experience with recording podcasts, so you can do it next time. Can you divide it up into chunks, or do you still need to train your brain to take it if we look at it in the long run? I know that Moose has made some experiments where he has found the oaks in the labyrinth, but... There is of course something about this that we don't know yet, but my guess is that at some point, yes, I think we can do it. That we can exchange experiences. And I think that what is exciting here is that when you can both, and the one you didn't really want to read up to start with was this input, but when we can both make input and output frictionless... So you can upload your brain... Yes, that you can both run it one way or another, completely frictionless. And that is of course a future scenario, and if it succeeds... We can't say for sure. My brother in the USA is working on some drones, and what they see, they load into the soldier's brain in real time. So there is something going on. I don't know how long they are with it, but it's all about getting there faster. One thing I find interesting about brain-computer interfaces is that this is something that has been known for, and the theory and the methods have been there for many years. But there has been a breakthrough in recent years. Now it has suddenly become very strong, also with the sensors. And because of the development that has happened with machine learning and AI, it is about to accelerate part of accelerating it. And if we succeed with quantum computing, then it will probably accelerate faster than we ever imagined. And what we can do today with a brain-computer interface, that you can control something real-time by looking at an interface. That's not what many people believed 10 years ago. No. But I think this is what brings us into an existential debate about humanity, where there are some who think that now that computers are starting to overwhelm humanity,ently, they will outcompete us. And if some Mars beings come to Earth in 100 years, they will find a functioning civilization, but there are no humans. It's computers that walk around and live in our homes and sleep in our beds. But then there is another school that says, no, that's not what will happen. There's a civilisation process for technologies, where first they're brutal, but then we assimilate them and tame them as a sensible part of our everyday life. And that part of it is, I think, that there will be a partial co-incidence between people and computers. Cyborg, transcendental humans, or whatever you call them. Centaurs. Centaurs, that's what they're called. So what you're talking about, and what I personally believe most about, is that you will have the option, or rather the possibility, to strengthen your intelligence with these interfaces. And in Jørts you will be able to make dog reading. So if you put a calotte on your dog's head, you can read out its thoughts. But Sune, it's incredibly exciting and I can't stop thinking that one of the most important thing is that we live in a country with freedom of expression, where we hope, and that's what you said, that you were with us to start with eye-tracking in its time, to make it cheap, democratize it, so that everyone gets to good, because the big fear is that these technologies end up in the hands of a few institutions, companies and countries. And it's top down, where you control who has to think about what and how and where they should be lifted and where they should not be lifted. And we have to be proactive and be part in creating what this technology should give us. Of course. And we can say that the society has a responsibility, but the companies involved also have a big responsibility. But in the end, the company is driven by the commercial interests. And of course, you can't know where it's going. That's why it's important that there are some guidelines that are set up that apply universally. We can't be sure that there may be some countries that will use some of these technologies negatively. And that's like with everything else. We can't control technology. But we can at least make sure that we have made some good guidelines about it. I think that there are examples back in history where it didn't work out very well, and there are examples where it did work out well, and I think that you just have to learn from that. And that's also the way to achieve a future scenario where technology is used in good ways and where it is positive for humanity. I heard an interview with Samuel Altman from OpenAI and one of his colleagues. And they were asked if we the AI away until we had made the rules. And what they said was that I think it's better that as it develops and becomes more and more advanced, we find out what it is. If we have time for it. Yes. So we have to find out what it is before we make the rules decisions. I think that's right, because you can't predict what the best applications are and where it will end up. So it's important that we do it along the way. So you get it out among people, see what on and then based on some experience, make a decision. Of course, but it shouldn't keep people back from making some good guidelines, some proposals, some guidelines today, that a dangerous company or society can start to adjust to. These guidelines were up, but I would say in relation to defense, globally they have not agreed to ban AI weapons that run autonomously and independently. So there are some areas where it is just difficult globally, and that's what's happening with technology now. There's a huge democratization process going on, so we can't control it. There's no longer the atomic bomb, four men saying, now we give each other a slap in the face, we don't want that. Or cloning of people, there were also four or five researchers who gave each other a subject. We don't want to clone humans. So it's a bit like the Wild West. It is right now. Yes, it is. But it's like with everything else, I think. I personally think it will find a game afterwards as it develops. Because we are forced to find some solutions and a play with it. But I am also a person with an optimistic or positive view on technology. In the companies I have been involved in, it is the same view we have had on it and have tried to find some games. But we've also seen a lot of examples where there has been fear when launching a new technology. And actually one of the things that we all, a little more low key, can relate to is when you introduced geolocation in our phones. There were incredibly large tubes around whether you should allow a phone to track your geolocation. And there was a game where you as a user can decide whether you want the phone to track where you are. And if we look at how the light is found, I think a lot of people make the setting on their phones themselves and are very aware of it. But largely everyone has it turned on in some way, because it gives so many advantages to have it turned on. And I think it will be the same with new technologies that will come on the market like this. And of course you have to remember that when you are swindling insurance or have a lover to turn off the geolocation and in the future you have to remember to turn off your thoughts and put on some thought-tank that the wife can listen to instead. Thank you very much for being with us, Sune. Very, very exciting. It was so nice. A future where IQ-boosting with brain implants has become freely accessible in all social classes and where everyone has the right to both become smarter and remember everything without having to make any effort, would represent an evolutionary development trend for humanity. But to get there, we must go through a number of considerations about equality, freedom and identity. Can you, for example, care about your private life in a future where everyone remembers the unhappiness? And should you transfer your experience to others? How do you protect the individual's right to choose to choose IQ Boosting? How does IQ Boosting affect children's education and upbringing? And how do you preserve cultural diversity in the future if technology contributes globally to the environment? Well Lars, that was mind-blowing, one might say. Yes, one might say that. I'm very proud that you you ending the show with recommendations to criminals. It's a whole new breakthrough for us, Liselotte. But it's super interesting and I would like to put it in perspective, because I have written about the future a few times. I wrote a book called Supertrins for the first time in 2009, and I made different predictions about the world. And sometimes I look at them and think, oh no. So most of what I've written is actually happening. But the speed has been quite difficult, to put it bluntly. Some things are moving all of a sudden. And this is one that is moving, which we also talked about, much faster than people had guessed. And suddenly, when something is moving much faster than you have guessed, then you start to think about, hold on, it's getting big, what does it mean? And I think that it's the beginning of something fundamentally comprehensive change for humanity. And I would say it in that way, we know the internet was a very big opportunity because it connected people and computers together in a network. And it had an explosive effect on our knowledge and our business and everything. But there has also been, purely computer-wise, traditional computing, AI computing, which is a completely different type of computer with other chips and completely different ways of working. Then, relatively soon, quantum computing will be introduced, which will be a third fundamental way of using computing. These three types of computers will be working together. And something that will happen is not everything that will happen. Something that will happen because of this is that the fourth type of computer, the human brain, is connected to the others. It's hard to predict what will happen, but it's easy to predict that something crazy will happen. Exactly. I think in a different way. In the old days, you had a typewriter, and then you got a PC, and you could write on it instead. But when you wrote on a typewriter, you thought in chronological order. You could move things around, and you would think in chronology. You would play around with it, so it changed our brain. Then we started using chatbots instead of writing. Then it changes our way of thinking and communicating. And when we go in and make a group where we think, it will be a game changer. I have to ask you, is it a nice to have or a need to have? I'm super excited about it, but I think, could we not have a great world without reading each other's thoughts and getting some peace? I'm sure that humanity could live without this technology, so it's not a need to have, but it will have a very big impact if we have it. Is it going slowly or fast? I would have said slowly until a few years ago. Now it's going to go completely and I think it's going to go fast. Now it's really going to run. Is it difficult or complicated to invest in this? We should have asked Suno about that. It's a considering start-up activity, but there are also game companies and headset companies and so on. So indirectly you can also be exposed to it in such companies If you have comments, questions or suggestions, please write to us on social media. Remember to share and like.

I actually think so, also in relation to China and the USA. If I am here and on Mars at the same time, and you do something with me down here, then it happens at exactly the same time as I am on Mars. The first satellite is launched as part of a space-based quantum internet. And that's where the five fuses go into my brain. If you really think you understand quantum, then you don't. This is Supertrends, the program where we inquire about all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertre about quantum physics and all the possibilities that lie in the future. It is one of the areas that you stumble upon again and again when you look at the future of finance, the future of pharma. It is like that it is what will solve everything. For a long time it worked like science fiction. You can also see when you google quantum, it is very a lot of spiritual people who say that we have more lives and we can travel around in them. But then there are also some skilled physicists who say that it can be done and there is something with a Schrodinger cat that can both be dead and alive at the same time and some infiltration and all sorts of things. So it's an area, Lars, that I'm really excited about, and we don't know much about. So today we've invited two of Denmark's biggest experts on the field. One is Lene Oddershed, who, Vice President of the Nordic Foundation and is working on a huge project for Quantum. The second one is Natasha Fri Saxberg, Director of the IT branch of the association and also the next chairman of the Danish Quantum Community, which is involved in promoting this sector in Denmark. So I can really look forward to becoming much, much smarter. A completely decisive difference between a classical computer and a quantum computer is their computing power and the way they achieve it. Where the computing power in a normal computer is dependent on the number of bits in the transistor, which can either be 0 or 1 at a given time, the computing power in a quantum computer is radically different. Quantum computers don't use transistors, but so-called quantum bits instead. This means that the computing power of a quantum computer increases exponentially for every quantum bit you add. Lars, when did you hear about quantum and quantum computing for the first time? I wrote a book called Super Trans. I actually wrote two different books called Super Trans. I copied my own title, but I wrote it in 2009. When I read about different technologies, I came to that. And then I read about people's opinions about it and it was very mixed between people who said it will never work and some that it might work at some point. I have a basic opinion that everything that is attractive and not in conflict with the laws of nature will be done at some point. So I leaned more towards that. It will probably work at some point, but it looked pretty bad that time. And then there was a long time when nothing really happened, and then it completely fell apart here in the last few years. Well, it It's from science fiction to science fact. And Google made a breakthrough where no one had expected that it would now be possible to make this quantum calculation. Yes, and then different companies came up and asked if they had broken the record they said they had. The problem with this is that when you dig down to really understand it, you come down to something that for most people, including me, ultimately is completely incomprehensible. Everything in life is like this. If you just dig down, you come to an explanation. I've only found four things where I simply die. The first is why there is something. Why is there a universe? Some say it's a collision between two other universes that made ours. Okay, where did they come from? And then some others say, well, it was made by God. Who made God? Then you stand there. And then there's the thing with, where do they actually come from? There's no sound. There are some who say they're out in Section 5 in some island in California or Nevada or wherever it is. And then you put some leads down in a drawer, nicely and quietly on top of each other. And when you open the drawer, they are totally filtered into each other. How does that happen? But Quantum is number four. So I have also looked at all the forecasts that our experts make about Quantum and they are a little incomprehensible. I look forward to hearing from them. I think we start with the timeline and then we can get our two guests to come with their bid for the future. Super Transmaskinen is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with with artificial intelligence, give a signal of when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. Should I just jump right into it? Yes, if you dare. Yes, so it looks like... And remember, Lars, we don't need to know everything about everything. No, but in this case I can answer that. It won't be for me, because I don't know much about it. But these experts do. I can see that between 20, 24, 28 people expect that it will be used lot of things in practice. Some have promised to create a small modular quantum data network in 2024. And then there is one that is completely long-haired, and I don't know if it really holds, but there are some who make a compass that is based on quantum computing, which means that you don't need GPS. I have a little trouble tackling that. And I must say, it's completely with pleasure that we start by talking about forms of application, because then we let the guests explain what it is at all. Then we have in 2025, it will start to become normal that quantum computing is used to make financial forecasts. And the finance industry has used mainstream computers a lot to understand what is happening. And very, very big, I think, is that in 2025, quantum computing will be used to develop new forms of medicine. We can hopefully get an explanation for that, but it is something about how molecules fold in three dimensionsdimensional structure. In 2026, it says that the first satellite will be launched as part of a room-based quantum internet. And that's where the five fuses go into my brain. And then the same year, 40% of all financial institutions use quantum computing to discover debt, credit card debt and other forms of debt. And the same year, they start using it for business. Finally! Finally, yes. I didn't know if I should go for cycle today, or if it was going to rain tomorrow. And in the same year, 2026, 40% of logistics companies will only use quantum computers to make route optimization, which is a typical quantum task. And in 2027, there is a company called Kisskit, which is starting to use quantum computing to make computer games, where they make something called a quantum blur. And then, for me, what happens next is a blur in itself. But there are some predictions, I'll just take a few more. There are two about quantum computers, they can break the cryptography, you should be safe in terms of bank information and so on. There is one from 2036 where you can crack the AIS 256 code. And then there is another code that you think you can crack 2046. There is of course a lot of uncertainty about those numbers. And that means that all financial institutions, they have to start working on post quantum security. How do they manage it when someone hacks it all with quantum computers? And then in 2037 Google comes out with a motherfucking quantum computing that has one million qubits, which means it can work completely without making any mistakes, because such computers can make mistakes. That was it. Fantastic. Thanks for that overview. Now I think the listeners are confused on a higher level, but let's see if we don't get smarter in a moment. Quantum mechanics is difficult to understand, because it is completely fundamentally opposed to our perception of the physical world around us. But if you want to make an experiment, here are two basic concepts. The first is called superposition. It is a quantum state, where a particle can be two different things at the same time, such as both 1 and 0 inside a quantum computer. The second concept is called entanglement. It is a quantum connection between two particles that makes them behave independently of the distance between them. No one knows exactly how or why superposition or co-filtering works, but it is known that thanks to these phenomena that quantum computers are exponentially much faster than the classical ones. So I would like to welcome you, Lene B. Oddershed. You are a professor and senior vice president at the Nordic Foundation. You have received more than 1 billion kroner to develop quantum physics in Denmark. Welcome. Thank you. Can you start by just seeing if you can get us to understand a little bit of what it is? Because it has nothing to do with zeros and one numbers and some computers. It's a different kind of machine, right? Yes. A classic computer works with bits, classic bits. There can be a condition that is zero or a condition that is 1. A quantum computer works with units called qubits, and they can actually be in infinitely many conditions. And in this way, a single unit from a quantum computer can contain much more information than a single unit from a classical computer. And that's actually the big difference. And also the way the individual qubits interact. They use some principles that are completely different from the principles used in a classical computer. And who can you invite into this machine? As a future researcher, it is also a challenge if so few people understand what it is about. There must be a critical mass of developers to get you somewhere with your project. Yes, of course there must be people, engineers, researchers who are extremely knowledgeable and skilled in technology. But it is actually just as important that those who need the technology, they get involved in the development and they make a pool, where the technology makes a push and the applications make a pull. One of the big challenges we face is actually to get the two ends of the coin to meet and get people to speak the same language. Either they come from the quantum nerd environment or they come from the areas that could really benefit from using a quantum computer. And the communication and the use of this between the different environments is not trivial at all. And one of the things I thought could be really, really brilliant was the fact that Internet of Things and getting different types of data to talk together is something that is really difficult today, and that's where you hope that quantum could come in. But can you tell us a little bit about, there was also something with some fault marks, and what is your mission all about? The quantum computer has a computing power that I think is impossible for us to understand today. And that computing power will give us access to break codes, as we also heard about in the introduction, and will be able to understand how proteins fold and a whole lot of other uses that we really will need in the future. So we can go from all that we are talking about now, with treating diabetes, to maybe finding the cure for diabetes, because you can't suddenly shorten the protein and other things in a completely new way? For example, if you want to develop a type of medication that affects a specific disease, and you want to affect a specific receptor in the cell membrane, then you can design your medication in a completely different way. If you have the power to understand. If you make this sequence, it will follow in this way, it will have this functionality. It will save the developers years in the laboratory if they can get very far with the simulation. I would like to give a very concrete example, which is actually a little more in the context of the climate. There is an enzyme called nitrogenase, which is used when making ammonia, which is an essential component of fertilization. And the process used to make fertilization is called the Haber-Bosch process. And if we didn't have it, we couldn't breed about half of the world's population. An incredibly important process, but at the same time an extremely energy-consuming process. It requires very high temperatures, very high pressure. It uses 1% of the world's energy, as far as I remember. Correct. 1% of the world's energy and excretes 1.4% of the world's CO2. So it is actually quite responsible for the problems we have with our climate. If we could understand how the nitrogenase works, if we could understand the important catalytic step right there where the energy transfer takes place, then we could make a much more efficient process that doesn't require high temperatures, high pressure, etc. We could reduce the world's energy consumption by 1%, we could reduce CO2 emissions by 1.4%. It would really, really move. Is it because it calculates for another solution, which it then tells us? It's because the quantum computer can with its large computing power tell us much more precisely how a protein or an enzyme works. So you can optimize it? Detailed, very detailed. It's a detailed and precise information that we can't get with the computers we have today. They are inaccurate. So we get a form of precision? We get an extreme precision, yes. Which is actually really, really important. Well, that's what we couldn't do with these. But now you say it's on this tiny area, and you can go back and forth. Because when we first cracked the code, we can use it in many places, or take the time to move it from this feeding area to a farming area. When you first have... Is it possible... Try to explain, Lene. How does it look? A computer. Can you describe it? Yes, it has different shapes, but the general thing about the way they look today is that you need to cool your cubits down to the absolute zero point. That means they have to be in some fridges and the electronics are really difficult to deal with. So today it is very far from something you could imagine, that you could walk around with in your handbag. But the funny thing is, if you had asked my parents in the 60's if they could imagine that every child would have a computer with them at school, they would be shocked. If you ask me today, can we carry a quantum computer in a lady's handbag, I would say no, we can't. But maybe we can actually do it in 30 years. We have just talked about Lene's future education, so I imagine that it is the school bag of the future, that you come in with your little quantum machine and do some exciting calculations. But you use all these words like to calculate and calculate and at the same time it is not these zeros and dashes we have been used to in an IT system. Don't you need a whole new vocabulary about this? Because it's a bit like getting to talk about paper and lead when you're on your way into another universe. Could that help anything? Do you think we'll get a whole new vocabulary in a bit? Yes, we need a new vocabulary, but we also need a new understanding, a new level of abstraction, because some of the things that the quantum computer is based on are some phenomena that can be quite difficult to understand. For example, what is called superposition, if I may try it. It's on my level with socks, so go ahead. Yes, I would love to hear about that. A classic example is Schrödinger's cat. So Schrödinger takes his cat, which he otherwise keeps, puts it in a box, closes the box. Inside the box there is a radioactive material that falls with a certain probability over a certain time. Then there is a geiger counter that can measure if there is a fall. If there is a relapse, then a gift is given to you, and then the cat dies. With the same. It wasn't very sweet. No. With his red fingers. No. But fine. So now the question is, when this halving time has passed, then the probability of the cat being dead is 50%. Now the question is, is the cat dead or is the cat alive? And the box is closed. So the case is... What do you say? I think it's a statistic. It's 50-50. Is it dead or alive? It's 50-50. It's like if you play in a casino. The thing is, it's a supposition between the dead and the alive. So it's while the roulette wheel spins? Yes, it's actually both. And you can't say if it's one or the other. At the moment you're making the measurement, you open the box, then it's either dead or alive. But until you make the measurement, it's actually a superposition of the two states. So what might be a different way of thinking is, you don't know a state before you've done a test. And then the test forces you to be in a condition. And that in itself is mind blowing, but it's also about thinking both conditions into your calculations. And that's what creates an exponential complexity. Yes, but that's actually fantastic. When you have so many states, such as the atom, the electron, the photon, or whatever you have, can be in. And that's actually what gives it the great power of calculation. But isn't that also what, I know you're a professor of physics, but isn't that what the spiritualists talk about when they use the word quantum, they mean that you can have many different lives, at least in the mind. But in the world of physical world, there can be many conditions. I have to ask you about something else, Line. You can't skip this. It's also about, if I'm here and on Mars at the same time, and you do something with me down here, then it happens at exactly the same time as I am on Mars. There is nothing to travel in time or anything. It is immediate that what you do with me here, you do with me the other place I am. You must like to tell that. It's called being entangled in quantum language. So it's one of the two new words we need in our language. To be entangled in quantum language. One of the new words we are going to use. You can prepare two atoms so that they are entangled, they are interrelated. Their quantum states are dependent on each other. So if one... Let's say two electrons. You have two electrons that are entangled. So the state of one electron is dependent on the state of the other electron. For example, if their total spin is 0, then one has to have a spin of 0. other has to spin minus 1.5. Then they are 0 together. That means that if you know the condition of one, then you force the other to be a certain condition. Regardless of whether one is on Earth and the other is on Mars. And that was actually what Einstein called spooky action a Distance. And he didn't believe it. Yes, that's right. There was some disagreement there. But do we believe it now? Yes, it has been proven. Okay. And where do you think it can have any meaning? It has a big meaning for a quantum computer. The conditions must be in place before you can do these calculations. The other thing I want to ask you about is that I know that you are on the hunt for the Holy Grail. Can you try to explain a little about that and is it something you have heard about on Lars' timeline? Yes, so it was actually, so you say that Google, Lars says that Google would like to make a fault tolerant quantum computer out in 37. The fault tolerant quantum computer is the Heligral. Already today there are what we call NISQ machines, which means Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computers. So you have quantum computers, also with thousands of qubits, but the problem is that there is a lot of dust involved, so you have a hard time relying on the calculations that come out of it. Making a fault correction is extremely difficult on a quantum computer. On a classic computer, you always make a error correction. It's simple because we have zeros, we have ones and every single step we can control. And that's not the case on a quantum computer. That's why it's very difficult to make the error correction. And part of it is also that we simply need better materials, we need better quantum materials, so we can better control the individual state. So part of our mission is to develop these quantum materials, so we have much better control over the quantum state and the way they interact with each other. And through that, actually make a fault-tolerant quantum computer. And when you say a fault-tolerant quantum computer, it actually means that the errors are corrected. All errors. Lars, you have a question. Yes, I do. Can you tell us how fast the progress is in terms of performance from the computer? It's a computer. It's a quantum machine. Quantum machines. I can say that Google said 37, but we actually said that we have something that works in maybe 27-29. So we are more optimistic than Google actually. But are we talking about the speed of improvement as the law of Moore or faster or slower? Much faster. Is it something with it being hyper exponential, so the exponent is also exponential? It's hard to say when we don't have the computer now, but the exponent will be, but it's definitely faster than a double. It will be a completely different size order. We just have to keep the weather with all that energy and everything until you have got control of it. Because when it comes, then we others will work as if we are working with a snail's speed. That's what I mean. You absolutely must not sit with your hands in the air. It is really, really important that already now that the company, I'm sure Natasha will talk more about it in a moment, is starting to become quantum ready. That you start using the tools that actually exist, for example these NISQ machines that actually exist, start training them, understand how it is at all that you interact with a quantum computer, how do you program a quantum computer, how do you get information out of a quantum computer? You can do that today. And many of them can be accessed for free over the internet. Is it something that you will primarily use on a computer that is somewhere on the internet, or will companies have their own? As it is today, they are all around the world. You access them via the internet. It's likely that they will be available in several places. So you buy the time when I went to the university, you booked time on the mainframe computer, which was the only one. And today you can access some of them for free. If you want to be a high quality machine, you will have to pay for it. Thank you, Lene. And we may be returning to you if something happens, but now I think we should have Natasha on the line. In 2022, the NATO Defence Alliance has placed a Centre for the Development of Quantum Technologies in Copenhagen in cooperation with the Danish Defence. The Centre for Quantum Technologies is part of the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen in NATO countries. Natasja Friis Saxberg, welcome to you. You are the next chairman of the Danish Quantum Community, and also the IT-branch director. What has made you so fascinated by this area? Thank you, and I would like to share that. I would also like to start by making a disclaimer, because you were so nice to say that I was one of the country's leading experts, and I simply can't take that. But I would like to take it on me that I am infected with a completely crazy cancer. I would like to say that it also makes one an expert, that you are professionally curious about this and actually go and listen to all those out there. Because there is a need for someone who gathers all the people who are sitting and, as you were saying, Lene, nerds this and gets them to cooperate. But what I would say is say is that my role is to be a missionary and to build a bridge between what the real experts know and what you might understand better when you are in an organization and not have this fantastic knowledge on a technical level. So I would like to take that on. But I was infected with the fever, which I didn't want to get infected with. Back in 2020, before the whole corona-lip. I was sitting in a midday out on the Riffshal island, where some leading experts from Holland sat. A center that runs the national strategy for Holland, which has a center that is used for business. There were some Americans, there were Danish researchers, and they told us that we have a leading position, but it's as if we don't really know the treasure chest we're sitting on and the gold we're really worried about. That's probably what got me thinking, okay, I might be able to do something about it. I'm the director of the IT industry and have also been one of those who took over the Danish startup environment when we didn't have that. So fixing that there is no light on big and important things is very fascinating. What is the quantum tradition we come from in Denmark? I would like to add that I can only supplement, but it is more than 100 years of research and not least a home with the Niels Bohr Institute and Niels Bohr as one of the world's first and leading in the field. And in the cold water at Niels Bohr and the Institute, there have been many other universities in Denmark that work with quantum technology in different areas. And what I might have to say, which is important to understand, is that quantum technology is already here. There are three areas within QANT. One is sensing, which is what we have when we are in the hospital and are scanned by an MRI scanner. It is communication, which is about cyber security and encryption and all that. And then there's the quantum computer. Yes, it's called a quantum computer. You can call it that, Lars. And the quantum computer is the one we're talking about coming out in the future. But the other areas are here. And what we have in our phones today is also a lot of quantum technology. So we must just look at ourselves and say we're just holding on to 27, 29 or 37, depending on which bottom we're going to hold on to. We have to relate to it, especially within security, especially within communication, because we have to be ready for this post-quantum reality, we can't wait for the computers to be here. I'm sitting with Enisa and there has been a huge development in the cyber attack and I have to say that we are making a whole program just about that and everyone is sitting and waiting because who comes first, the criminals or the heroes who have to ensure that these cryptocurrencies cannot be broken? But where do you think the great potential for development lies? And now it's not by chance that you are in the IT industry. Will that be the natural leap for our IT industry, so that when we as ordinary people work with our devices, it will flow together? Or how do you imagine it? Well, quantum computers or quantum technology is an enabling technology, so it's not a windmill, it's not a phone, it's not something we can hold in our hands. That's probably why we have a hard time understanding it, because it enables a lot of other technologies and a lot of other developments. And then it's also important to say that it's complementary to the classical computer, as we know it, or the computing power we have. And it's only a few computing problems that the quantum computer is particularly good at. So it becomes a supplement. But what we will see is that we actually put the technological development on steroids within a few areas. And we do this because of the fact that tomorrow's law, as you mentioned, Lars, is reaching its maximum. We can't get the leaders closer to each other. We can't optimize the processing power as we have done with that speed for so many years. So what comes after tomorrow's law is quantum technology. So that's what's important and exciting to understand. We probably have a hard time understanding the scope of the development, as we had a hard time back in the early and mid-early 1800s, and understand what kind of industries, what kind of innovation, what kind of technology comes out of the whole microprocess development. And that was one of the things I was asked about here at Frukos, when I said I wanted to talk to you. They said, well, it's those who know when humans are overwhelmed by a quantum computer and then find out that we humans are bad for the planet and then destroy us or put us on reset. And then he said, maybe we have already been put on reset. I think we can handle that ourselves. But is that it? Will it be a superhuman thing we get out of it? Or where do you see it if we take the long future glasses? It adds some computing power and intelligence, which allows us to achieve results we couldn't before. 64 qubits can contain all the information we have on the internet, just to take an example. And a quantum computer is the only one that can calculate the complexity of penicillin. So there are some areas where we simply haven't been able to accelerate before, which gives us a new course to run on. But I'm not one of those who believe that as soon as we get a technology, a robot will come and destroy us, and these examples. I believe that it will be complementary, and I believe that there is human being sitting with one hand and controlling the technology with the other. Because we will also have to do a lot of learning and we will have to do a lot of things we have to learn from too. But that's how it is with development and it is not out of the question. And now you are talking about that you think that the human being will still sit with his hand around holding the pin. And even today you can talk about who is holding the pin. Are it the tech giants we have or is it all of us? So I think we should also have that discussion. Who will own this technology? I was very happy to hear that the Novo Nordisk Foundation is working on this. How do we ensure it's in practice? We just heard from Lars that Google is very far ahead with this. Where do you see this in the future? We need to differentiate between hardware and software. And when we talk about hardware, there will probably be a few who have the technology. We know IBM, Amazon, Google, Nordisk for some years. So there will be a few within hardware. On the other hand, on the software side, we will see a lot of innovation. But what is important is that there are different actors. And different actors, and we already see a lot of startups today that are also on the front. We have in Denmark some called Quantify, Q-Devil, MQS, and there are more and more. So there is a difference in the two areas. But what is important for Denmark, and the most important thing for our business life, is that we are starting to cases. Logistics companies can get a huge competitive advantage when they can deliver green supply chains such as Maersk or Ørsted, which can calculate the best windmills placement. We work a lot on these use cases to ensure that we can get Denmark in the front on that part. Lene, you also have your hand up for that. Yes, about the position of power and what is necessary for us to do. It's correct that Denmark has historically a position of power with the Copenhagen University of Engineering, in of Mathematics 100 years ago. And there have been some changes of different kinds, both from state and private funds, that have strengthened the quantum method. But right now we are actually in a position where there is a need for an immensely larger investment if we are to maintain a leading position. And that is what we have gone into now with the Novo Nordisk Fund. We have put in half a billion Danish kroner to create a new quantum computing program. And the reason we call it a program is because it is just as ambitious as the Apollo program. In the Apollo program we want to build a rocket that will reach the moon. Now we want to build quantum technologies that can solve real problems for us. And it's actually just as ambitious a project. And we actually compete with the big tech companies. And there may be a little more ambitious than you, Natasja. I think private companies will not own this alone. So our center we are making here is actually in academic direction. It is located at Copenhagen University at the Niels Brugger Institute. The things that are being developed are coming to the fore all over the world. And at the same time, when I say that, it is also super important for us not to be naive about the geopolitical situation. Because it is a race we are in. And those who come first, so that you can break a code in the whole world, can access all data. So we should not be naive about this. We also need to protect the technologies we develop and also protect them to a higher degree than we are normally used to in the Danish university environment. I looked at a graph that shows patent distribution internationally and quantitative technology. And apropos geopolitics, China is in the US. It is also a large country. And then the USA comes afterwards, and then it is far, far down to Japan, Canada, South Korea, England, Australia. But it is first China, then the USA. And now I know that patents can have different qualities. But as you say, there is also a geopolitical risk in who comes first. Natasha? And it's probably not Europe on any of the things. Maybe not on any of them? No, yes. It has to be Europe. So now I'm going to be ambitious again. But completely correct what Lene says.. And to your point, Lars, the US invests 1 billion dollars a year from the government's side, and China invests 50 times as much. And we are in Denmark, completely on the same page. And if we didn't have someone like the Nordic Fund and others who threw money into it from the private side, we would be in the third division. So it is insanely important that we also get some capital from the government side, and we make sure that we get the education places, so we can educate these people. Because we can sit on top of enough gold, but if we can't get the competences out in the business, if we can't get the use of classical computing and quantum technology, then we have no chance. And again, they will be thrown elsewhere in the world. But hardware is more expensive, I can imagine, at a current time. So it can be China, USA are leading in hardware, but there are also a lot of possibilities in developing software. I'm just guessing. Within the semiconductor industry, Europe has completely lost its chance in building an industry. It's all in Taiwan, now the USA is starting too. But I would actually say that within the quantum field, we in Europe have a real opportunity to become the leaders. I actually mean that. Also in relation to China and the USA. And at least within some specific areas. Regarding patents, it's not entirely certain that it is the only target. Because part of this is developed as business secrets and is not patented. Because a patent can be copied from China, for example. We have a big challenge here. If there shows that if there are many, and now you are talking about education institutions, private and public actors, the more that come together, the better it is. I know that's also your opinion, Natasja, and the importance of getting as many started as possible. What do you read when you have to read a book? What kind of education is that? What can I become? Can you come with different backgrounds? There are many different education systems. We have seven universities in Denmark that offer different education systems in quantum technology. We will also see new education systems being developed, because of course this use of technology is also very important. And I think you can answer that better, Lene, if you inspire some young people to do education. I have been teaching physics for 20 years, and I would say that it is not easy to take a course in quantum technology if you have another course. It is not something you can learn in two months. It requires a little more, a longer effort, where you actually have a part of fundamental courses before you reach the level that you actually understand. It's a completely different way of thinking than you are used to in classical. But maybe it's not necessary that everyone has that background. One thing that is really important is that those who have that background are able to communicate with other people. So you can build a bridge between the different professional disciplines. And I think that's a good thing to do, but it requires an effort. You don't even need to know how computer chips work or what machine code is to be able to make high-level software development. No, but Lars, at the beginning of the IT industry, there was no data science education. There were a lot of talented people who developed the whole thing themselves. And then came the education afterwards. And here I think maybe we're looking at the opposite scenario. I don't know. But it is interesting, because we are talking about people living for many, many years. And if this becomes a game changer already in 2027, then I can imagine that at least some of us will have to go back to school. What do you think, Natasja? Well, it is an important, important source to hold and preserve and strengthen the leadership position we have and we must continue to have. We do not want to become customers of this technology. We must deliver this technology within the areas where we are leading. And of course, without people we will not get anywhere. But as one of the leading real experts, Charlie Marcus, who is also at Kagen, says that if you really think you understand quantum, then you don't. So I'm a little relieved. And what is especially important in order to understand it, is the reality of the industry and focusing on what kind of problems the quantum computer can solve. If they come to terms with problems, then there are researchers who can translate it to how to solve it with technology or with research. So you have to dive deeper into what we would like to solve and then build on the competences. And if I then pull the beam out in 2050, Natasja, what are the solutions? Is this an extension of the IT industry that has morphed into the quantum community? Or is it a third or fourth industry? It is an enabling technology, so we want to see a development within several industries. What is important is that we work together between the actors, and that is also what the quantum community has to do, so that we can accelerate ourselves, so that we learn from the development we are in. And then it is also crucial that we get the Danish national quantum strategy out, which is on the way at the moment. Because that's where we set some ambitions as a nation, where we get an understanding of what we should focus on and what we have to get started to achieve this race. But you say in 30 years, there will soon be a little less than that. We can expect that we have a really powerful quantum computer that will make a difference in chemistry, better batteries, electric cars, green environments, as mentioned before, and carbon capture technologies, which we are already seeing a start use. And then the whole medical field with drug discovery. And then we also come to see artificial intelligence at speed, because we can turn the volume up on the power of the clock in some areas. So, you know that better than anyone else who is a future researcher, we as humans are not good enough to predict what will happen in the future. But this is so crazy that we can't even understand or imagine what this will affect. And I know very well that I put you in an impossible role, because it's like talking about light in the mirror and then asking yourself, what will the light be shining on? I think that's the picture we can use. Lene, if you have the 20-50 glasses on, what do you see as the real winner? And that's the whole point of this program. What technologies will turn the way we usually do things upside down? And then you have to say, this qualifies. Yes. If I were to be a future researcher, I would look at what gradient we are on. And I would say we are on an extremely positive gradient. If you look at 2050, the students today will be extremely responsible for how the world will look in 2050. And if you look at Denmark, we are educating twice as many quantum experts per investor as number two in the world. We are number one in the number of investors in terms of educating quantum experts. So we are on a very positive gradient. This, together with our extremely strong research environment, makes us very attractive, also as an investment country. And NATO has seen this, has seen. NATO has chosen to place a quantum accelerator in Denmark, even though Denmark was in competition with many other very strong quantum environments in Europe. And we now see a very increased interest in foreign companies from the United Kingdom, Japan and the USA, who come and talk to us about the possibility of investing in quantum in Denmark. And all these tendencies together, I would say, if I look at the crystal ball, I look into an extreme acceleration. And I look into a scenario where Denmark actually becomes a quantum hub and becomes a power center. That sounds absolutely fantastic when we hear you two talk about quantum future and also very ambitious about our tiny country becoming a hub for a life-changing technology. Thank you very much for being with us today. And I want to hear from you, Lars, in a moment, how do you invest in this? And it might get a bid on it. It takes up to 10 years and costs up to 2 billion dollars to develop and market a drug. According to McKinsey, quantum computers will make the process much faster and much cheaper. So among the many industries that will benefit from quantum computers in the future, will be the pharma industry. Among the companies that have been the fastest is Swedish Roche, which in 2021 initiated the world's first quantum computer-based research in molecular combinations to possible future forms of treatment against Alzheimer's. Lars, where do our listeners sit and have understood that this is the holy grail and it comes before you think it will. How do you get started with understanding more, investing in it? It falls between two stones, that's not what they say. Because you can invest in some of the very, very big IT giants who have such projects going on, but it doesn't mean much for their income in the short and medium term. Or you can also invest in these start-up companies that work with it, but that normally happens through venture capital funds. But you can also be a member of some angel investor forums where you can directly invest. And now it was mentioned that Denmark has a quantum accelerator. And then maybe some people think it's a machine. It's not an accelerator. It's an environment that helps start-up companies get started. And so there, if Denmark is good at that, there will be a possibility for private investors. Do you want to make an investment comment? I just want to say that more and more start-ups are coming all the time and we also see private investors at the business angel level who are in the areas. So everything from completely smaller angels to the big venture capitalists. And then you can, if you are a newcomer but do not understand it, then you can syndicate, get someone else to have the competence and spend some money on it. That's what AngelForums often does. My assessment of the investment opportunities today in Denmark would be that it is primarily dominated by relatively small start-ups, but with a fairly large potential. So we are relatively early in the investment chain. If you want to invest in larger funds, then there are foreign companies that are just standing and have the need at the current time. But it is risky, I would say. To go out with the big investments in this area right now. It's very difficult to value the companies. And a slightly different time horizon than classic energy investments. Yes, and the mistakes in these machines. But I have to read a lot more about this in the coming years years and I look forward to it. Hold on Lars, we have become so clever or so ignorant. Everything is surrounded by plants, but I think it has been incredibly exciting. So what do you think? Is it a nice to have technology or is it a need to have? Could we live without it? We could live without it, but it is a technology that will help extremely to develop our efficient precision economy. So it is really great. Yes, we've talked a lot about energy storage and also to hear what is being said in relation to this with fertilization. I would say it's a need to have if we are to make the energy storage before the earth burns down. As I said, some places it will make miracles, other places it won't have any meaning, but it's really good. Then we come to another really interesting question. Does this go with snail speed or does it go fast? Everything that runs faster than a mother's law, all It felt like it was with Sniles speed, but now it goes really fast. And there's an accelerator effect. Multiplicator effect. As we saw, many of these practical application breaks will happen in a few years. Difficult or difficult to invest in? Difficult, I would say. And will you be rich, sustainable or clever? All three things. No, most clever, right? Think, how clever we will be. All three things. Well, is this a tiny supertrend or are we on one of the biggest? We are in the next highest class, I would say. It's not like energy transition with... No, I'm standing with my finger on the button. No fantastic is how many people it can bring to good use. all of us. And it becomes a phenomenon that we all enjoy. So it may well be that we can open the machine for all of us or bring it with us as a school bag. This was a teaser for one of the technologies that will mean a lot to us. We will follow the development of NOE and we invite you to do so. Thank you for listening to this episode of Supertrends.

The show where we investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrends, Lars Tvede. Welcome to an episode where we will probably talk about one of the most important aspects of the future at all, namely climate change. Because when I am asked as a future researcher if there is something I fear with artificial intelligence and robots coming and gene manipulation and one thing or the other, then it is always that I end up saying it should probably go all together. But right there with our climate and biodiversity, there are a lot of unknowns. So I look forward to welcoming our guest a little later, Morten Springborg. Welcome. And I also know that my market from Supertrends, Lars Tvede, is one of his favorite areas, both in relation to investments, but also he is sitting and counting and counting and numbers and what happens if we do one and what happens if we do the other. Because as I have understood it, it is not one thing you can do, it is a lot of things. So you have to keep your tongue in your mouth in this program, and then I'll probably try to ask a lot of questions on the way of us listeners. Welcome to... Lars, is there a reason for me to go and be about whether my children and their children can be here on the planet? I don't think so, but we will probably get a couple of years where we will be struggling with this energy transition that we will have need. I want to set the stage for how important I think this conversation and this topic is. It is like this, if we hadn't had access to use other energy than ours, we probably probably not have come much further than the Stone Age. And that was something with the average life age of 20 years and terrible diseases and so on. And then they started using animals to help themselves, and that lifted it up a bit. And then they started using fossil fuels, and that lifted us from the Middle Ages to where we are today. So we have to be a little grateful, actually? We have to be a little grateful, I think, because on so many fronts, life is so much better. We are standing here after having a shower with clean clothes, a nice breakfast and a cappuccino. And all of this can be referred to as fossil fuels that have helped us. But now we have to move on, we have to get out of it. And my guess is that in the history of mankind, the fossil fuel period will be around 300 years. And we are well into that and approaching a plateau entrance in this century and then probably a very rapid development. But it is complicated to make this transition. And one of the things that got us to make this exhibition was some research done by a Czech economist who lives in the USA, his name is Smil. He is a very, very nerd. He finds all his exciting subjects and then he just lives down there as if he thinks it's a lie. And he has then shortlisted how long it has taken historically to energy investments. His method has been that when a new energy form has been invented, and it has reached 5% of global energy consumption, it means that it works, that there is a demand, that it can be done, etc. And then he says, what happens in the next 50 years? What does it grow to? He starts with coal. So coal grew, after it had reached 5%, it grew in the following 50 years to 40%. Then he looked at oil, it grew to 30%, Then he looked at gas, it grew to 20% in 50 years. Now some are talking about solar wind, and I know that not everyone does it, but some maybe who are more activists or don't know much about the actual relationship in the nuclear industry. But they talk about solar wind taking the whole thing and then we solve it all and it should be done in 2050. Solar wind is responsible for 3-4% of global energy supply today. I think it's 3.3%. So it hasn't even reached 5% yet. But to think that it can go from where we are now up to 100% in 30 years, would be completely out of line with everything we've seen so far. So we have been used to, or I am used to this digitalized society, that things are getting smaller and smarter and faster, that you get much more for less. And what we are talking about here is that you get a lot less for more. And that's a bit difficult for us to understand, because we're used to those almost exponential curves, and things get faster and smaller and more compact. But shouldn't we listen a little to your timeline here, because it is a bit different compared to many other technologies we are looking at. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. Lars, you have been out looking at experts and I know you are sitting here and noting down. I look forward to this timeline, because you can potentially be looked at many thousands of years ahead. Yes, we have many, many hundred forecasts similar to energy transition. So I have chosen some deadlines just to give a sense of what is happening. One of them is that in 2025 we should have a fuel plant that will deliver 4 GWh from wind and sun in Saudi Arabia. But the interesting thing is that it is actually fire. Fire is a liquid fuel where you lose a little over half of the energy when you convert to fire and then back to use it. But it's a pretty big facility they're building there. So in 2025 also, the first nano nuclear reactor supplied with used nuclear fuel will be used. So there are two things in it. First of all, it's a very small nuclear power plant. Secondly, it uses nuclear waste. So instead of preserving it, you start reusing some of it. About 98-99% of it is actually reusable as fuel. Does the waste then come out of that fuel? Yes, it does in that way. There is something called nuclear fusion where there is no waste, but I will get to that in a moment. Because the same year 2025 there is a permanent nuclear fusion process in an experimental reactor. It is the technology that is up in the sun, where the waste is helium. And helium is not radioactive, and you can use it to blow balloons up to Children's Day, and then you sound like Mickey Mouse. So it's very exciting, but it's an experimental reactor. Two years later, you start introducing electric cars with graphene batteries. It is important to have more alternative battery types. Today, only 1.4% of electric cars are electric cars. If we scale it up, we can easily get some bottles of lithium. So if we can do it in other ways, it's good. The same year, we expect that there will be Kalium-ion batteries, which can also take pressure off the lithium supply chain. Then we have 2030. The collected distribution costs for Brent, which is an alternative to oil, will drop to 40 cents per dollar. This is getting interesting. And when I look at different commercial prognoses, like mine, it says that Brent is starting to give meaning around 2030 to certain things. Not so much to cars, but for larger machines and for factory equipment, industrial processes. And then 2030 comes, we will talk about that more here in the broadcast, it is the Traveling Wave. There are some who have put in that there will be a distribution issue of Traveling Wave reactors. This is something that the development chief at Microsoft, Bill Gates, has invested in. And that is for the re-enactment of nuclear waste. And if it works, and it's a very simple facility without many moving parts,. If it works, then it's estimated that the nuclear waste that is in the USA can supply the country with all its energy in 800 years. That would be great. 800 years. Then the costs burning in China and India and Western Europe falls to 2 dollars per kilo. To understand this, you should understand that burning is more difficult to handle than oil, but it also has a much higher energy density. So you get a lot of energy out of these two dollars per kilo. In 2031 we get batteries that can be charged in a few seconds. It is very important for the use of it. And then we get in 2033, it is probably the largest the biggest milestone ever. The world's largest economically viable commercial fusion plant will be put into operation. And then we can use heavy water to generate energy and get helium out of it and get insanely much energy that can supply us for many billions of years in reality. Lars, to understand why we need all this energy, can you just briefly explain how much energy we need? Is it increasing or is it like today and that it needs to be covered? Can you give some pictures of that? Since 1950, the place has somewhat been similar to it with about 2.6% or 2.65% of it per year. And there is all kinds of viewpoints to it, it just continues. There are a lot of countries that are not part of that curve. Yes, that are part of it. And even during during the lockdowns, there were no people. So it was a little bit of a burden, but very, very little. It will not change. We have to expect that it will just increase. And that the energy consumption of the world is much higher in 30 years than it is today. Okay. Well, continue with the timeline, but it was just to find out if there is more energy to it. I think I would end on a high with it. I can just take one more. In 2036 there is a fire factory that is based on bacteria, that is, genetic manipulation of bacteria, so they produce fire. That sounds exciting. Yes. Thank you very much, Lars. Among the interesting tendencies within the energy transition is the speed of development seen through the ongoing advancement of green goals. Here are three examples from 2022. Example 1. In June 2022, the Austrian government advanced the expansion of gas in new buildings from 2025 to 2023. Example 2. In November 2022, the British financial institute Barclays launched its adoption of coal-fired investments in the USA from 2035 to 2030. In October 2022, car manufacturer General Motors set a goal to run all American production facilities on the road to 2025. That is 5 years earlier than their goal from 2021 and 25 years earlier than their goal set in 2016. Morten Springborg, you are a specialist in CEE and you have been in the Energy Commission under Lars Løkke. You are a political student, so you have spent many years investing and of course looking at energy transition to find out what is a good investment on the planet's side, which would give a good boost when you look at the long run. So there is a bit of a future researcher over there. You have at least known to take the long perspective on your investments. So should I be worried about this energy transition? I don't think so, and I will agree with what Lars also said that yes. The next 10-20 years will be volatile and difficult, but I also think that the timeline that Lars describes, which I agree with, gives a lot of hope. There is a big technological breakthrough ahead of us, and we can already start to be very specific about what they are, because the companies exist and we have within a very short time had some very large technological breakthroughs, which have accelerated the emergence of these new technologies. So what will be the big game changers on the short run, that we should keep an eye on? And now we are known in Denmark to look a lot at wind. What else, what else do we hope will come on the track soon? The reason I say we have a difficult time ahead of us is that we have under-invested in the good to simply promote what we think is the perfect and it has been wrong. You have to explain that. We have, as everyone should be familiar with, a huge focus on renewable energy sources. And that's fine, because the renewable energy sources will get a much larger position in our energy network than they have today. They have to grow. But we have also, at least over the last ten years, done everything we could to bring down the investments in the fossil industry. And in it has gone hard over our natural gas investments, which have been halved from 2015 to 2021. And natural gas is a really, really good transition technology, because it eliminates half of the CO2 that coal does. Coal is the biggest disruptor in this history. And what we have seen in recent years, following these sub-investments, is that we have actually had an explosion in CO2 emissions, because we lack natural gas today. Why? What is it that is emitting instead of the others? It is coal that has been driven up. We have also shut down coal in the last ten years, but it is the only surplus capacity we have had in our global energy system that we could start up again. So we have seen that European countries such as Italy and Germany, and for that matter also Denmark, will soon burn coal that they had not planned. But the biggest offender is China, which is the world's largest source of CO2. And the largest source of CO2 in China is the Chinese coal industry, which produces four times more CO2 than the Saudi Arabian coal industry. But when you have to convert, and the program is energy conversion, you don't have to put a line in the sand and say, now it's enough, and now you have to find something else. Otherwise, we could just continue. Yes, but you have to understand that economic growth is simply energy, which is simply transformed into economic activity. And if we don't have energy, we don't have an economy. So that's why I say it's a bit critical, because we actually have a share of global energy balances, and that will stretch far into the end of 2020, before we potentially see that these balances are recreated. So we will live in a range of energy shortages. Why is it so difficult to replace oil and gas with electricity and solar energy? That is because there is a difference in the energy density. I postulate that fossil fuels have a very high quality and this can provoke some people. They have a very high quality in relation to the minerals. Partly because they do not fluctuate, but more importantly because they have a very high quality in relation to the whitewater. Partly because they don't fluctuate, but more importantly because they have a much higher density. The energy content per unit is much, much greater. The best example I can give is that a company like BP, one of the big oil companies, produces 2250 exajoules of energy. Ørsted, which is a fantastic company and has grown enormously in the last 20 years, the world's largest windmill operator on the coast, produces 25 exajoules. It's almost 100% BP. We have tried to promote growth in Ørsted so that BP could close down in the last 10 years. The consequence is that last year, BP's production fell by 7%, corresponding to about 6% in Ørsted. That's not why we have an energy crisis. So we're simply on the short run and there are holes to be made. How much are we missing? And how do you see this in relation to companies and society? Energy markets must balance. And that's the price that makes you... If the price goes up so the price goes down. But everything else, when we went into 2022, I would say we had a 100% growth of about 2%. And that would be around 8-10% in 2026. And it will take time to change this. Because we haven't seen the fossil industry start investing again. And it's not enough to grow sustainably, because for every crown we reduce fossil investment with, you have to grow solar and wind about 25 times to compensate for the reduced production of energy from the fossil sector. And we don't do that at all. I thought you said for every krona, you mean for every percent? No, I'm actually saying, let's say if you reduce fossil investments by a million dollars, then will have to invest 25 million in wind and solar. Can you give us an overview of how much of the world's economy we invest in building energy capacities? How much do we invest in electricity, how much in non- in electricity? How much do you invest in gas? How much do you invest in renewables? We invest in 1% of the world's GDP on primary energy. Over the last 20 years, about a third of the in has been in wind energy sources and two thirds have been in fossil fuels. And the percentage of the wind energy has grown in recent years. That's what we want and we have reduced the investments in the fossil industry in absolute amounts. But over the last 20 years, we have reduced the proportion of fossil energy in our energy system from 87% to 84%. And that just speaks to the open light, to believe that we can create an energy transition that brings us to a goal with 100% of the energy source being an illusion. So that means that you have brought down 3% of the energy source by 20 years. With this rate, you would have 15% of the energy source by 100 years. But at the same time, the total energy supply will double. That means that if we on like this, the fossil industry will just increase infinitely. You can also say it that way. The world's energy consumption grows about 1500 terawatt hours a year. And we are currently investing so we get a growth in the remaining at around 400. It does not matter. In other words, we are trying to fill a swimming pool with a little bit of lighter band. Completely. And we have to have some fireflies going. And this has to do with this term called density, which people will have to understand if they have to have a hold on the energy transition. Then it would be great if you could tell us what the different energy technologies are, carbon capture, carbon sink and all that we can do. Just give us a little insight. I'm very concerned now. You say it should be okay, and then I say that all those fine solar cells and wind and all that, that it's like filling a swimming pool with a span. A lighter span. It's a lighter span. It sounds really dramatic, Morten. Where should I put my hope? The hope is that it seems to me that there is an understanding, a growing understanding of what we have done in the last 10-20 years, that we don't belong to. And we have to do something else. We have to accept that we can't just focus on sun and wind and reach our goals. How many percent do we reach our goals with sun and wind? I don't think we can reach our goals in 2050. We are already too late. But that doesn't mean that we just have to get started doing the right thing. And that is different from what we have done so far. We have to accept that there are good and bad fossil fuels. And we have to get coal out. There is only one way to get coal out of, for example, China, and that is to offer them more natural gas. And that is the opposite of what we have done in the West, where we have reduced our investments by 50%. This needs to be changed. So that is the first step on the short track. The second is that we need to accept that the world's biosystem is a large CO2 system. We emit about 50 gigatons of CO2 per year into the atmosphere. But there are 3200 gigatons that flow up there in the atmosphere in the foreground. And half of what we emit every year is absorbed into our natural carbon drain. And what is a natural carbon drain? It is our forests, it is our gardens, and it is our soil. And my argument has long been that the cheapest and most effective way to reach the climate change goal is to manipulate these natural carbon-fruits by giving incentives to companies, states and individuals to invest in the expansion of these carbon-fruits, for example by growing forests. So, the transition from agriculture to... That could be, yes. And that also comes into many of the other trends that you are probably talking about, about the modern agriculture and all this. We do not need to have the same agricultural area requirements in the future. We will have a productivity growth in the land, which means that the land can give square meters where we can plant trees, for example. So what you're saying is that CO2 is not necessarily a ban. No, we need to understand that we will have an energy system also in 2100, where we have a lot of CO2 generation, but we need to handle the CO2. And the first place I would do that would be with the natural carbon rings. So what you just said is from coal to gas, if we talk about the next 30 years, from coal to gas, there a lot and more green nature, more biomass will move a lot. And that's good for our entire nature. Who can be against that? Batteries are central to the green transition, as we need to to store the remaining energy we store with green technologies. And therefore the price of batteries is also central. The most expensive batteries for storing energy are lithium batteries. And according to World in Data and International Renewable Energy Agency, the price of lithium batteries has dropped by 80% between 2010 and fuel cells have a lot of density and it's really hard to change them from 1 to 25 and therefore we need to look for energy forms that come up more. Can you point to some technologies that could help us in a world where the energy demand is rising, because hopefully we all get better and are more expected in terms of having different comforts in life? It is of course important that what will bring economic development and the whole development stage for humanity is that we need a better quality energy system with a higher density. And what we are trying to do at the moment is to go back to the densities we had before industrial development started about 200 years ago. So we are going the wrong way. We have never had economic growth driven by lower density energies. The conclusion is that we should move up in density. And there is one area that is of course open control. I have had the technology for 50 years and it has worked perfectly and it is nuclear power. What about all the countries that say it is dangerous and we have regulated it. And all the time when you start saying these things, then we are directly trusted on social media. Yes. I believe that common sense will win in the end. And we have begun to see that countries that have previously been rejected by the government have turned around. And that is of course something that has happened because of the crisis that arose after Russia invaded Ukraine. That there is a new realism about energy policy. And an acknowledgement of what we have done today has made us enormously vulnerable. So we need something that is more stable, more secure and much more potent. And that is nuclear power. And we have seen it in England, we see it in Sweden, we see it in France, just to be in our area. Poland will be a mega-large nuclear power plant in the 30's. You also talk about the fluctuations, when the wind is varying. It goes up and. And I understand that one of the challenges with nuclear power is that it runs at full power all the time. So I don't know how well it matches our wind and water systems. It matches well in large energy networks. I have recently been critical of the idea that Denmark should have nuclear power plants, because we have such a large number of fluctuating ones, and it would be difficult to incorporate a large nuclear power plant in Denmark. But when we look into 2030, we have some other technologies, these smaller modular reactors, SMR reactors, which will be very easy to integrate into the system, because they are smaller. And I have a vision that it will not be national companies and states that will inevitably run nuclear power in the future. It will also be companies. We have already seen, for example, that a large mining company in Poland has been out and making orders on 12 SMR reactors to replace the coal power plants they use in their production. So it is the future that we get small, modular, flexible power plants, also that deliver electricity to the industry. Then I can't help but think that now there is an energy crisis, as there is, then more will come to the fore. Everyone looks that way, because that's also where the good investments are. So could one couldn't hope that it would accelerate the development. So if you're now standing out in 2050 and giving your picture on how the energy supply distribution looks like at that time, what is the transition that has happened? Have we gone from one way to a new way? Or are there a lot of ways? How would you describe it? I think we should go back to what Lars said and quoted from Smil's analysis, that these energy transitions take time. So 2050 we are not a goal yet with anything that we can say is the final solution for our energy supply. But it will be a mixture of different things. It will be natural gas until the end of this century. Then it will be renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. And it will be nuclear power. and it will be what we call third generation power plants. The ones we know today, they will operate until around 2073, perhaps. The newest of these plants. And then the new generations come, these fourth generation power plants, the smaller, modular, flexible ones. And when we get around 2030, we will begin to see the first fusion power plants in our network. There is an American company called Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which is private, you can't buy shares unless you find the company that is the main shareholder, which is an Italian energy company. You can buy it if you are interested. But they have promised that they will have commercially connected electricity production from fusion power in the USA in 2032. There is uncertainty about this timeframe, but I am pretty sure it will happen in the 30's. We also have a single company that is far ahead. So there are huge, huge hopes for a much better energy and climate future when we start to escalate these enormous energy sources in relation to what we are trying to grow today. I was just thinking about turning this into energy density, because that is central to what you are commenting on. So I happen to know that the energy density at at nuclear power plants is 12 million times as high as at coal. 12 million, that's something. But can you give us a little understanding, if you take a standard nuclear power plant in Europe, in Germany for example, before they shut it down, how many windmills and how much is needed to deliver the same, including the backup structure that needs to be corrected for inequality? One way of looking at density is what you point out here. I think you should have a windmill pack that is a couple of hundred square kilometers or something like that to make electricity to a nuclear power plant. But it can be that you have space for it. There are many places in the USA where there is a lot of space. So that has been the argument from the wind industry and that is not something that keeps us back. But where I think it really becomes critical with this identity, for example in Denmark we have this idea of building an energy island in the North Sea. It costs 200 billion kroner and it will produce energy that will be converted into these so-called power to X molecules. And if you imagine that you have made what is called e-metanose, which can be used for production in container ships, then it would be the answer to the fact that this 200 billion kroner investment could create energy for 26 container ships. If instead of... And how many container ships have masks?? MERS for example has 700. Okay, so there's a lot of value. It means that you have to make 30 energy islands to the zone. Just to support MERS. So 6,000 billion euros to supply MERS fuel. But just to get back to the issue of density. If you continue to do it as it is today, and Maersk gets its bunker fuel from conventional oil, then it costs around 10 billion kroner to make an plant that produces oil for ships compared to 200. There is a factor of 20 to the difference, minimum. And that is also an expression of the differences in density between, in this case, wind and fire, and on the other hand, fossil fuels. But if we now say that we like it, so we want to have sun and wind, we want to have all of the sun and wind. Can we do that, Lasse? Then I would say that our world economy is burning together. Because it will be an enormous... It's blowing together, we have to say. We will have an enormous productivity problem. We will not be able to create the economic well-being and surplus in our economy that would be able would satisfy the demands that the population has on the future of sustainable welfare. But can you deliver the industrial metal that is needed? Not today. And that is also something that we as the World Trade Union have said to the mining industry. We do not wish that you will up because you get uranium and we do not want to invest in your companies. So the last ten years, the mining companies have done the same as the mining companies, namely, they have stopped investing. And that is a huge problem because the whole green transition is based on an assumption that you just have unlimited access to critical raw materials. And the critical raw materials should probably be in the shell of the earth's surface somewhere. We should probably be able to find them. But there are no one looking for them and there are no one who really throws a lot of capital after them at the moment. Does this have anything to do with this ESG, Environmental Social Governance investment filters? To a large extent. Does this prevent investors from investing in mining? It doesn't, but there is a great amount of skepticism about it, which makes it problematic for institutional investors to be especially active in this market, which is really important for the energy transition. I think that one should address the entire ESG problem a little differently, because it has become quite obvious today that the greatest losers of the way we have handled the energy transition and our ESG filters have been the poorest people on earth. You need to explain that. Yes. One thing is that the Danes are heavily pressed on the economy. We ask for and get heat checks thrown in our heads. But there are many out there who do not have states behind them that are just as robust as the Danish. And there are many exchange economies are falling as dominoes at the moment, because they simply do not have access to modern energies. Europe has handled the war in Ukraine and the lack of access to Russian gas by importing largely all the LNG, which is liquid natural gas. And that has meant that the prices have exploded. The European price, or what we in Europe have paid for LNG, is perhaps ten times the price we have paid historically for Russian gas. And that means that we have simply just stifled the market. And that means, for example means that countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka are completely out of the market. They can't buy modern, heavy, dense energies. What do they do then? They go out into the woods and then they fall into the woods and burn the trees. But why don't you, when the prices have gone up so much, why isn't there more gas production in the USA, for example? It doesn't do that for several reasons. One is that Biden promised, in connection with his election a year ago, that he would not allow more to be used in state-owned countries in the USA. And he has kept that in mind. So there is no growth in the American shale industry today. It can come back. Shale is shale gas? It is shale gas, yes. The other thing is that it is difficult for European natural gas importers to do much more than buy in the spot market. Just to say what is available in the market now. What they should do is to go out and say I am interested in buying 20 years. We get a long-term contract for 20 years. Because then you would see that the exporters in the USA or Qatar, they would actually start investing to deliver this long contract. You can't do that because of the European legislation on taxonomy and it's such a complex legislation that is fundamental to the way that you think the financial industry should allocate its investments. Natural gas is well enough green, but it will be issued in 2035 and it takes a short time to get these long-term contracts, So nothing happens from the European import side. Now you say it becomes extremely expensive with electricity or the transition here, especially in developing countries. Isn't there just turbo on the solar cells then? And isn't it just getting cheaper? And what kind of development curve, for development curve is the sun on? We need some forms of, what can you call it, burning platforms. Something that creates an incentive for people to close down to the old and put turbo on the new. We have seen a huge inflation in the cost of solar panels in the last few years. Many of the inputs that go into the production of solar panels are in the cost of solar panels. And basically, it is driven up by energy prices. There is a very large energy consumption in the production of solar panels. It seems a bit bizarre, but that's how it is. And they are actually fossil fuels. So what you also need to understand is that if you want to accelerate investments in white-collar energy sources, then it means that we will use a lot more energy to begin with before we get it repaid. And we are already in a critical energy situation today. So the time to accelerate such a sustainable energy investment should have been when there was enough energy so we didn't have this problem. It takes two or three years to get the energy that has been invested in the production of solar panels back to normal before it has produced it. So it could well be that we are in a critical situation and we doubled the production of solar panels and windmills this year. That would only make our energy crisis bigger. In the short term. Lars, you would like to hear about WAVE, would you? No, I would like to hear... There is a part with these small modular reactors, for example. And we also saw in our timeline that there are expectations that the Traveling Wave will start, which is another nuclear power technology. Can you tell us a little bit about what you think about it? It's also expensive to build, right? Most companies say that they will have a leveralized cost of energy, that is, a long-term cost of energy production for such a power plant over the entire life span of the power plant will be around 30-40 euros per megawatt hour. What is that? That is where the prices used to be in the good old days a year ago or earlier. So it is a competitive price and it is on the level of what we see that the current solar and wind can produce in good regions. But the difference is, in contrast to solar and wind, which are fluctuating energy sources, it's what we call baseload. And that has a completely different value. So we get something at the same price that has a greater value in the future. And there are 40-50 companies all over the world that all offer their own designs of these reactors. And I have an understanding of a few of them, and I have a great confidence that this will probably succeed from. From around 2028-2030 we will start to see the deployment of these directors in the markets around the world. And it has become okay to invest in them? There is no ballad or taxonomy or whatever else? No, no ballad there. Except that unfortunately most of these companies are still private. But they will probably, as they grow and need more capital, also start to come to CapitalMind or to the open stock markets. So where does it happen? There is a lot in Korea, but can you tell us where the activity is? We have two in Denmark, Seaborg and Copenhagen Atomics. They are a little different, but they are the same. Their origin is the same. One company has been invested in uranium and the other in thorium. One company has already sold reactors to Vietnam for delivery at the end of the 20's, but still expects that they will have their approval in place. And it is generally that most of these companies are still struggling to get the permits to go commercial. There is a company called New Scale in the USA, which is listed on the stock market, which has its permits from the American Atomic Regulation Authority and has already sold its first reactors to Poland. The aforementioned 12 reactors to a Polish mining company. So this is starting to become concrete. What are the biggest obstacles? Now we are far out in the future and finally there was abundance, that is, an infinite amount of energy and with the density that makes it also enough money and all. What were the big barriers when you look back? Is it technological change, are there regulations, is it war? Where would you say it was this and that and that? I think maybe the biggest thing is that we should have changed the whole conversation about nuclear power, which has been going wrong for the last 20-30 years. People have, in my eyes, a picture of the safety aspects, both on the production side and on the handling of waste products, which is completely cut off from reality. Atomic energy is absolutely the safest energy form we have, including if you include the accidents that have occurred. It is the least CO2-reducing technology, also less than solar solar wind. So we need to have this discussion in our population, and we need to have a broader acceptance that this is the way we need to go to handle this situation we have with the climate and our general energy supply. And I'm very optimistic that this will probably because we must teach women to spin and we have a critical situation at the moment and several countries are already waiting. And these different energy actors, do they help each other or do they fight each other? Where are we? I'm not in the middle of the wall, but my impression is that they are very cooperative. Of course, they are all commercial and at some point they will be strongly competitive with each other. But they all have one common interest and therefore this will succeed. So my impression is that they talk as good colleagues with each other and help each other. If we look at the fusion side, we have worked with fusion in Europe since just before the end of the Cold War, when Reagan and Gorbachev worked together on a peace-making project called ITER, where they had an idea of whether they should together try to create a future energy solution. And that is this huge 200 football fields large power plant, which is being built in southern France. And it will never be a good investment, it will never produce net positive energy, but there are many technological innovations that the whole industry can benefit from. And has been a kickstarter, I believe, for many of the much smaller and more modern fusion reactors that we now see blooming. Among others, Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Togamak in England. So now I know that there are both worried listeners out there and then there are some who really want to invest in this and see the dollar sign in their eyes. Do you have any advice for them here on the falling rope, Morten? Because you are also working with that. The energy transformation is a very difficult trend or theme to invest in, we think. It is something where the states have huge interests in. Our basic opinion is that if you, for example a windmill producer or a solar producer, experience that you can generate over normal profit, then you will only have that possibility for a short time, then you will be regulated down. It's just a fact. So what you have to do is to try to look at areas where the state does not necessarily have its rights and regulations. And on the very short run, it is completely open. There is something like energy efficiency technologies that give better use of energy is a no-brainer. The cheapest energy we have is the one we don't use. So energy investments or efficiencies in, for example, electric motors, which can be enormously energy reducing or something like insulation of the house mass is an interesting area to invest in in the short term. The entire value chain within gas I think will be a significant industry change. But the very, very big, huge, multi-bagger investment opportunities that will be, I think will be when we start to have the opportunity to invest in nuclear technologies. And now I have to go back to what Lars said. Because he said that we will need more and more energy, and you say that the cheapest energy is the one we don't use. Can't you imagine that we are converting the modern society into a society that uses maybe half of the energy we use today, without it costing us anything in terms of comfort? In the last 20-30 years, the western world's energy consumption per capita has been largely flat. But we must also remember that there are about 6 billion people in the world who have not had access to modern energy, and we must give them access. The Americans use the energy answer to about 110 old watt electric power plants every day. An Indian uses 5. I'm pretty sure the Indian has an idea that he also needs a welfare approach that doesn't contradict the American one, but they have an absolute idea and they grow their economy quite significantly. And that will drive an energy demand, growth in energy, and that's what Lars is talking about. These 2.5% growth we have seen historically is driven by the Western front and we must hope it continues, because otherwise we have problems. Now I would to say thank you, Morten. And then I think I'll sum up all the exciting things you have said. Thank you very much for being with us. Thank you. The International Energy Agency published in December 2022 one of their annual flagship publications, where the agency according to itself came with the largest adjustment ever in relation to expectations for sustainable energy. The agency's expectation for the amount of sustainable energy implemented in the world by 2026 is 76% higher than it was only two years earlier. The adjustment was due to the increased focus on energy independence in the world and dedicated measures from the EU, USA, China and India in the cold water during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Well, Lars, what surprised you the most? Now that I've been around so much and you've heard many broadcasts where you've been with, I'm not super surprised by anything, but I think there is something very worrying about the sequence of what we should do. Because what we hear here is that in the long term, up to 2050, we can achieve a lot by replacing coal with gas. And gas is not perfect, but it is twice as good as coal in relation to CO2 generation. We can achieve a lot by using the natural, i.e. by using more green areas that absorb CO2. And while we do that and focus a lot on that, these extreme energy technologies will be developed in the 30's. And then they can start to take off. So I think it's a really good perspective to do things in a clever order, which I don't see in the normal energy debate. And that's because we're used to having a now, now, now society. We just want it to be organized with the same and then we take the things that are at hand. Yes, and there's also something about people being in love with a technology and then everything has to be that without thinking that very often with one one technology it is good in some situations and up to a certain extent. If you have too much of it, it becomes more and more problematic. For example, you run dry for metal commercially, if we have too much solar wind. Denmark is perfect for wind. You have to tell me about the mines, because you showed me a terrible picture yesterday, Lars. When it comes to the mining industry, first of all, both if you ask the International Energy Agency and the leaders of the biggest mining companies, Goldman Sachs analysts and all sorts of people, they say that there is not enough metal to make these dream scenarios with a lot of solar wind. But the other thing is, there are some terrible stories about some of these mines. They are extremely polluting. And cobalt from Congo, or most of it comes from Congo, many of their family companies are sending their children down in the mine shafts and then they come out with some spades on a market so we can feel good and clean in the west. So there is a shadow side of the story and the shadow side is in some way very much connected to the low energy density. They are so large and heavy, the facilities. They require so many resources and that is a problem. Otherwise, Lars, what do you say to the listeners? Should they invest in this? As it has been said, it is not super easy to invest in one-to-one in what you believe in. But I will say, and it will not be mentioned, that if you look at an international windmills industry, then generally close to a supply chain. But they use a lot of metals. If you look at the mining industry, which delivers these metals, it is a gigantic supply chain. So indirectly, you can buy into the value chain. So energy transition, Lars, is it a nice to have or is it need to have? It's as big as it gets, need to have, I think. And we can't just let go and use anything, lie on the couch and turn off the light? No, and that's the thing about energy transition, that you can't just let the weather be and use anything. Lay on the couch and turn off the lights? No. And that's the thing with... There are quite small holes in a western civilization where we feel green by screwing down our own weather. It doesn't move. The target can't be registered in the statistics. It's technology that has to do with it. And is this with the transformation something that goes slowly or fast compared to what we are used to? I think it goes like competitions do, namely first slowly, then fast. I think that a lot is happening happening in the 30's. Super. So we have to wait a bit. Is that what you call the hockey stick effect? Yes, the ketchup effect. You go and... The ketchup effect is when you hit a tube and nothing comes out, and then suddenly splash, and half of it comes out. All this research is not really followed in the media, but there are made very large land wins in the form of research and development, and suddenly we start to see these facilities, and then it starts to work. Difficult or difficult to invest in? A little difficult. Okay, and then you become rich, sustainable or clever if it succeeds? You become rich and sustainable. And is this a small supertrend or a huge trend? It's a T-Rex in size. Yay! We've been through energy transition and as you can hear, it's a somewhat complex subject. It requires a lot of different technologies, it requires someone who is curious about each other out there, so that you don't suboptimize and close down for something that might have a chance on the short run. It is really an subject where you can use some future researchers glasses and set timelines and try to prioritize the right timing and it's definitely not easy. This requires a lot of people who know what they're talking about and what's up and down. I'm a bit out of this, and I just have to say that it has made me even more curious, and if you've become even more curious, then I would at least advise you to listen to some of the other episodes we have about both nuclear power and thorium and sun and wind and carbon capture and whatever else? Burned. Yes, burned. Thanks for listening to this episode of Supertrends. If you have comments, questions or suggestions, please write to us on social media. Remember to share and like.

Before we made this episode, I had some glasses on, and I'm standing very high up in a tall building, and then there's a plank that goes out, so I have to go out on that plank. And I didn't do that. It's clear. Gaming has been a huge driver, but it's much bigger than that. It's the understanding that the future is already there. It's just incredibly divided. This is Supertrends, where we investigate all the developments that will affect your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrends, Lars Tvede really got to know this Metaverse was with some architects, where I was invited to an island bridge in a dome. We went in and suddenly we suddenly we were in Avatar and then we were in Vejle. And Google Map showed in real time the traffic in Vejle. And then we had to find a parking spot where a bike bridge would be. And then I thought, just shut up, how smart is that? And especially that I'm not going to lie and drive to Vejle by train back and forth. And at the same time, I just got placed there and it worked incredibly well. And then I think again that now you are here with me, with your body. And that's what I'm so happy about, because you live in Switzerland. I always take my body with me. Yes, but you don't when we meet on the different online media. And I feel incredibly uncomfortable every time we have a guest in the studio who is not with his body. And I can also feel the same on the broadcast that I miss some energy and some feeling. And therefore I am also really happy that after we've heard your timeline and everything, we'll have a fantastic guest in the studio, namely the future researcher Sofie Wittfeldt, who is in the process of conducting a Delphi-examination of what will happen to the metaverse and has made some very exciting scenarios for it. And I can see that it's a bit of a paradox that she's not here in the Metaverse. I mean, the walk the walk. But what do you think about that, Lars? The first thing I want to say about the Metaverse is that I also experienced it when I was about to build a boat and we had to make a change in the shape and they gave me glasses and I stood in front of the boat and looked around and could just see how the change looked. So that's the first contact with it. But I think a about my experience with it. People have actually talked about the fact that you can travel around in virtual worlds for a long time. And I think the expression is from the early 80s, the metaverse. It's an old thought and it reminds me a little bit of digital telephony, where there were a lot of startups that wanted to make digital telephony, and some of them came to me, for example, if I didn't want to invest in them, and they didn't. And then suddenly there was one called Skype, which hit the jackpot, as it should be done. And then after that came Zoom and various others and then it just ran. And it seems like the metaverse is also something that people have been circling for a long time, but now it's starting and we are in the process of making it work. What is it going to be used for? We can start with gamers. There are 3 billion gamers, who are sitting there, working. It has become very popular. But you can also use it for shopping and work simulation, for example pilots who can train in the military. I was forced to talk about a very personal story in this program. I have been granted by my son. But when he was 14 years old, he borrowed my husband's credit card, and it wasn't his father. I think he was 13, but after he was confirmed, it cost me a lot. I found out that he had some small bills on my husband's credit card, like 50 kroner, 100 kroner, 150 kroner. And you can't see it, there's no Playstation on it, it's just some weird VDK or something. Well, he then found out about it, my husband, and he's angry, because he has simply spent 32,000 kroner. And confronted with my son. What have you spent that money for? He says, to buy various equipment in these games. As a future researcher I have to say, interesting, exciting. It was really interesting that you can get so much virtual value there. And then I called as a mother to the Playstation and the rest. What do I picture? I have locked my little son out in a misuse. And then they said, we can easily send the money back, it's not a problem. I could hear them, there were mothers who called every day, saying, you just have to call the police and send the report to us. And I didn't want that, he was just 15 years old. So as a mother it gave him great consequences, I took him out of his apartment and the same day I rented his apartment out to a Syrian refugee, Osman, who is a good friend of mine today. He eats lunch with us and was really happy about his new apartment. My son was then homeless and I threw him away from the games and went out to get a job so he could start paying back the 32.000 kr. But as a mother, as a future foreman, it has really been in me. The reason I'm telling this story on the radio is that I've had mothers come to me where the children have used their work credit card. They have almost been fired because of the debt with credit cards. It says something about how important these virtual parts are for our status. And these gamers, as you say, they will grow up and become part of the labor market, so it will be a natural thing for them to bring in when they design the future. Yes, so they build their locality in these virtual worlds. And there is now... What you talked about is real money for a family economy. Oh yes. But there is already a lot of money in some of it already. Microsoft got a contract from the US military for 22 billion dollars to deliver headsets for simulation of combat situations. 120,000 of these 3D headsets and of course access to the virtual world where it happens. Which in turn leads me to the definition of it, if I dare to oppose it. Then the metaverse is the 3D universe, the integrated 3D universe. In a way, it's perceived as something big integrated. And then it builds on some technologies called Web 3. But it's like Microsoft. We also have Walmart, which missed online shopping, where Amazon ran ran with instead of getting it. They don't want to miss this, so they have a lot of work on it. And then there is of course the company called Meta, which is called Facebook and then they invented the holding company, which is the stock market company for Mita. And which has invested completely astronomical amounts on developing this in 2021, it was around 70 billion crowns. That's a lot of software for me. And then later in 2022, they came into they were in financial trouble and cut something down. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives a signal when future groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. And of all the timelines for different technologies in the Super Trans machine, which we have looked at in connection with these programs, is the one about the metaverse the most problematic, because those who make predictions about it are quite disagreeing about how fast it goes. I think it falls more... That's why we need scenarios later, that's so cool. I think in a few years, there will be much more agreement about it. But what we can see is that they say in 2025 it will be broadly visible. That means that everyone knows about it, and everyone knows someone who uses it, and some people use it. And then in 2028 it will be mainstream, meaning that it is also very common that the business world uses the metaverse to sell and to simulate things and things and so on. In 2030, we are a bit further out, it will start to become common that you have a metaverse digital shopping assistant. So if you go into, for example, I think it's in Ilum, that you can get a shopping assistant on one of the floors. But it's a digital one, so you're like with one and tell one what you can find where and what fits together. And to that I would like to give a hint, a timeline, because Hyundai, who makes cars, they have simply been out there saying that they want to make metaverse mobility. And that means that while I'm out shopping in the store with my virtual shopper and say, God, I forgot to give the dog food, I can visit my own kitchen and get a robot that they they have delivered, probably with small Christmas under, to pour some food and water up to the dog and maybe pat it a little. Maybe even take a walk with it. But I can simply control that from the outside. So what happens at this point is that the boundaries between real and real are being wiped out and that we can start controlling things from the metaverse also out in the real world. In a super practical way, for example, that you can go into a catalog online, for example, and look at furniture and then you can take some glasses on and see how it will look with the furniture or the table in your own living room. And it really looks like it is there. So it makes the purchase process much better. It's about 20-30 years that it should be. That's something that the owners need so much, because it's the dream of the future home. And it already exists, but now we're talking about when it becomes widespread. When people play around in synthetic worlds, for example in military exercises, then the computer tracks what they do. And because you can do more and faster and cheaper in the synthetic world, then the computer can learn something about behavior and consequences, and they can then use and transfer them to the physical world, so that the physical world becomes more efficient. Then in 2040 we have some experts who say that at that time, about 5% of the world's population will be in the fully immersive metaverse. Fully immersive means that it's 3D for all senses and it's very realistic. And you feel like you're there. Before we made this release, Lisle, you gave me some 3D glasses. I'm standing in a tall's a plank that goes out, so I have to go out on that plank. And I didn't do that. I thought you went out on it, I thought you stepped around, then it was in the elevator, and you just stood there. Yes, and it just felt so uncomfortable. If you had given me a cappuccino, I would have probably done it, but you don't offer that The last thing I have is 20-40 years old. It would be very broad if you have a digital twin. A digital twin that follows a lot about your life and habits. And then one guides to, now you just have to be careful with it, now you just have to be checked for it and so on. So it's like you have two different identities, one in the real world and one in the digital world. And then I will end with one that is a little puzzling, I would say, and that is someone who has said, in 2040 it will be relatively normal for psychologists to help people with developing multiple self-syndrome. That means that you are Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, who have two completely different personalities, one digital and one in the physical world. And for people who are really into the, it can be confusing. Fantastic. And in terms of tech, I know it will be even wilder. Now you didn't dare to go out, and there was a little sound and such, but in the next version it's with scents and you can hear the sounds precisely and then you can even lick on things and taste them and you can get haptic feedback, so when you fall you feel the wind resistance. So that means I can taste blood in my mouth when I hit the asphalt. It will be interesting. The meta universe is a virtual phenomenon that is formed in a colossal network of 3D worlds in a virtual reality driven by wide-ranging and digital technology. But the consequences of our actions in the metaverse can certainly be overlooked in the real world. Some work for example on creating pockets in the metaverse where people can have enlightening experiences that make people want to connect stronger social relationships or protect biodiversity in their physical surroundings. Others work on creating completely direct and more pleasant consequences of our virtual actions. An example is the contractor Palmer Luckey, who has developed the VR headset Oculus Rift for 18 years and has since turned into a weapon manufacturer. He is currently working on the world's first VR-glare, which is capable of killing the bearer of the glare in the real world, if the avatar of the person dies in the metaverse. Sophie, you are employed as a media officer at the Institute for Future Research and Senior Advisor. That's my old workplace. I think it's so cool that you are starting to do a bigger Delphi-investigation, where you ask all those who have their fingers on the pulse in relation to the metaverse, what will this be about? Because future research is always one part of looking at existing technology and science, and then another part, and what then? And what then? And it's first when some visionary people come on the field who make the the killer apps, that something is happening. And therefore it is a fantastic work, and I have been looking forward to talking to you. But can you not give your words on what is Mediaverse in the first place? And what is a Delphi survey? And what is a Delphi survey? First of all, before we dive into that, I would like to say thank you for the invitation to be with us and to zoom in on what the metaverse is, because it is really important that we get a common language about the future, and that is what you create here in Supertrends, so it's so cool to be a part of it. First of all, what is the metaverse? And one of the reasons why it's difficult to make a timeline and predict something about the metaverse is, as Lars also rightly says, that there are not really anyone who knows what the metaverse is. We do not have a common definition. It is a fusion of our virtual and physical worlds. And now you mentioned that something was right and something else was virtual. I think that the way we look at our realities will change. Because the virtual reality is no less right than the physical reality. And you can see that when your son goes in and spends money and sees so much value in what he also has in the virtual world. It's right for him. So it's not a false reality. And that's something we should of course look at in relation to how our future will look like in these metaverse. So a general fusion of our physical and virtual world, where we start from having an interface that is on a flat screen, and as you are also right, we will probably get to that, and look back in 15 years, God, why did we look at such small strange screens? So all this is going up in our surroundings, and it becomes much easier to navigate in, instead of navigating on. And where do you think the development is going fastest? Because it covers NFTs, and you also have to explain that. And then there are a lot of commercial interests, then there is the creative world of art, you come with background in the media, so you must also look forward to this future. When you look at all this development, where do the big drivers come from? Gaming has been a huge driver for me. Some of the big players in the metaverse are Unity, Nvidia and other players that are involved in the gaming world. But it's much bigger than that. And I think it's that understanding that the future is already here, it's just incredibly divided. A lot of the things we're talking about are already here, but there are also a lot of technologies and killer apps that haven't come yet,, and we need to be ready for them. So I'm super excited to see what it will be like. I think it's interesting to have a concept like the metaverse, which is a couple of layers of many of the technologies we've seen in the past. Because yes, virtual reality has been here for a long time. There has been work on augmented reality, you know, a 3D machine has been here for a long time and there are many of the technologies that have failed. So how do we keep ourselves on our toes and keep us involved in all the gigantic investments that are within this area in all sorts of places. So if you just want to tell us two things about these NFTs, and we can go all the way to the front, but they are some who really invest in this system with artwork and all sorts of things. Exactly, because one thing is these immersive layers, these 3D layers that we've talked about, but another thing is the whole infrastructure and ecosystem that lies underneath, which is what we call Web3. Web3 is super interesting to look at, because it's what supports NFTs, which are Non-Fungible Tokens, which are digital assets, I don't know how to translate it, best in Danish, but which you can own on a blockchain. And that means, it's a way of taking something that is digital, where you say, okay, we have a picture, digital JPEG, everyone can own it. But when you have an NFT, it's only you who owns the concrete, what can you say, the concrete entity, which in general, and you should be a little careful about that, is not only a flat digital entity, it actually gives access to things, is often part of a community and can create a lot of engagement. And it's one of the things that drives the metaverse forward. So just a little thing, I know you're also jumping up and down Lars. When I bought a Gucci bag in that fine Gucci store that is located in the metaverse, does that mean I can take the bag with me to Roblox or some of the other universes? Can you take it with you around in the future, do you think? Now we're talking about possible scenarios, and we've made some scenarios. If you get started with them, we'll take Lars' question first. I would like to answer your question, because you're talking about interoperability, the fantastic expression that is impossible to express. When will we be able to take these things from the different virtual worlds, or the worlds that will lie on our physical worlds, and simply take it with us, because we can't do that now. So when you have bought your Gucci bag inside Roblox, you can't take it with you. There are some companies that are working on it, also in relation to having an avatar that can be all the way around in different virtual worlds, for example Readyplay and me. But right now you can't take your digital assets around that much. Super. I have few comments about some of the things we just talked about. First of all, a digital Gucci bag was sold on Roblox for $4,118. Another thing is that in our timeline, I don't think, some people say that around 2030, some open standards will start to emerge, so that you can take things with you from one scenario to another. The third thing is, as you said, that you can buy clothes and instruments and so on, but it also gives access to some things. And speaking of access, so Fortnite, as one of the most popular games in the world, which has around, in a typical month it has around 80 million different players, they also make events, and they became very famous for it. They made a concert with Travis Scott, and there were 27.7 million people who watched this concert in metaverse. So it's a big deal. It's a big deal and it's fantastic for a star of a star who doesn't have the guts to perform on different small stage scenes evening after evening. Then you give it a go once and you've earned what you could earn in 20 years. But Sophie, can't you try to draw these two scenarios for us as well as you can? Yes, and there are four that I work with. We have our... We try to four. Yes, you can say that try to make it four. We have very smart listeners listening to this program, so we can handle it. Yes, but I think the idea is that you have to look down on some of these uncertainties, because there are so many uncertainties about how this is going to develop. Because even though we are talking about these open standards, which are not already there, open standards and companies that work together to make open standards, but it does not mean that this is how it will be. If we talk about Web 3.0, as we have mentioned before, it is in contrast to Web 2.0, which is what we see right now, where there are some big tech giants that own and control different areas within. Search, social media, shopping, Amazon, Facebook, Meta. The different big players. Who are they not also the ones who will control where we move into this immersive world? It's a huge uncertainty if it will be proprietary, that is owned, closed systems that are created by the big players, not necessarily the ones we know now, or if it will be open on this Web3 and become more, what can you say, users, owners, and it was what we dreamed of when we got Web2,0. We thought it would be that big democracy, everyone would come to terms, and then it would be a winner takes all. So that's super interesting. So that's two uncertainties we can point out. And the second uncertainty is, will we become a metaverse? And those of you who have seen Ready Player One out there... I'll explain it. Ready Player One is a blockbuster movie by Spielberg, and we have a book on it. But where it's the world you talked about, Lars, with 5% in 2040, which is in fully immersive. There you have a dystopian world, a physical world, what you could call a real world. And then you jump into this one metaverse that one man has created, and that one man can own the winners of this big game. He just goes in, the main character, in a haptic suit, sits down in a chair, puts on his glasses and is fully immersive. I could think of telling a story from the real world. It was a Norwegian boy, 22 years old, unfortunately ALS, and the parents were so sad about it. They said he was the world's loneliest boy. He was sitting there in a dark room with rolled down curtains thinking he had a life without a single friend. When he died, 700 people from all over Europe and the world came to his funeral because in Ready Player One he has just been a hero, a super star, mega cool, mega strong, had a lot of friends, and therefore I also think it has such a fantastic attraction, because there is also something including that we can be with each other. 100% and you can say that some of the megatrends we work with, like globalisation and connectivity, that we can get much closer to each other, it's such a beautiful story. But I know this is your dystopian scenario, where there is one big and then it makes's so attractive for us in there, that we don't want to be elsewhere. It's like you're sucked in. Exactly. So that's one part of the uncertainty, where the other is that we have a lot of separate worlds. And a bit like we have now, where you go into very specific things, so it's not like we have now, where you go into very specific places to do very specific things. So it's not a big, collected place you go to. If I were to give a picture of that to the listeners, I would say that the Chinese model is that everything is collected in one app today. And if you look at us, we have many different apps for different things. So that's probably the insecurity axis. And what was the other axis again? The other axis was if it was open or closed. And if you look at the... And open, is it if you have a layer on reality? No, open is the ownership. So that's what we're talking about when we talk about Web3. Who owns the data that is created? And in general, who creates it? Because all the worlds we are now in, all the visualizations we will move around in and buy, are probably created in high degree of artificial intelligence. But that's a longer talk. But that's in reality what it is to make scenarios. It's a concept you should use in your business or if you are to invest in this, then try to find out, well, what do I think most about the development goes from and then try to think each of of these cross-fields. Exactly. Take the biggest uncertainties there are, build some scenarios so you can practice in the future. We can't predict the future, but we can practice where we might end up and then ensure that we slowly get the businesses to be structured so that it fits the possible future. Sophie, if you are going to try it today, you have heard this program, how do I actually get started? Do you have three or four things you can do to get in bed with the media world? There are some big things here. The metaverse still has a place. We will look at that later. But we will look at that later. So I think it would be nice to have the first little details. Exactly. It's about dipping your toes in what might become the metaverse. And it's much broader than people think. Try to go into a virtual world. What kind of world? Try to go into Decentraland, which is a virtual world that is flat. Because in the beginning, these virtual worlds are probably more flat, because we simply don't have access. There are not many people who have VR glasses. So it's quite difficult to create a big attraction. And that's also on these flat virtual worlds like for example the Central Land. And do you meet anyone there? No one at all. And you, like me, have a hard time navigating around, because you need some gamer skills to navigate with your keyboard. I don't know what to do, to be honest. But it's exciting to dive deep and see what this is all about. How is it to be represented as an avatar in a virtual world? I can't help but imagine myself during the first Covid lockdown, I was in Zurich airport. I think there were 20 passengers in the whole huge airport. Is that so? It was really dystopian. Yes, but it is. In fact, they have also been quite angry, because at the Central Lane you could buy land for huge amounts. Now you talked about 4000 for a Gucci bag, here you have millions for a piece of land, for example, next to Snoop Dogg or something. There is also another country called Sandbox. Yes, it's something that shows a direction, but I don't really believe in these things. But try to go there and do it. Try, of course, in VR. Get access to VR or go out on the board. Get a feeling for VR glasses. I have to say that we just played with them today and they are quite heavy. I wouldn't be able to sit with them day in and day out. They are really fun to have on for an hour. And then you're tired. you are completely exhausted. And that's exactly what is starting to develop. The very first VR experience I had was back in the 50's in one of those, I can't remember what it was called, Morton, who made a giant VR machine and the same with the computer. When it was made, it was so big that people predicted that it would never become something that individuals have, because it's too big. I remember that Wall Street phone he was taking off with as one of the coolest things. So yes, we can imagine that it will get better. I think that with contact lenses you just throw in the eye, we have a problem with putting things in, and Elon Musk is also with his brain interface. And there are some headsets made today, where you actually, for military purposes, where you get transmitted worlds into your head. And if we are in the dystopian, because I think it's a little dystopian. As a future researcher, you can not say if it's good or bad. Just interesting, exciting. But in any case, I never think we will get a future that is neither dystopian or utopian as it is in sci-fi. But people already now have made attempts to go into people's brains and influence our dreams. And that's through signals. And I think that's very interesting and a little scary. But if I may come up with two last things in relation to dipping the teeth. Because you also have to be careful with putting the metaverse in the same line with virtual worlds that are fully immersive or completely closed. Because all these AR layers, Apple for example, Tim Cook, who is CEO at Apple, he doesn't believe in the metaverse in the way that Meta and Mark Zuckerberg believe in it. He believes augmented reality. This thing about having glasses with a layer on it, like the contact lenses you were talking about, that will change our world. And they've just come up with something where we could actually hold a meeting and have eye contact. And already that's a huge thing. If we two can sit in augmented reality and see each other in the eyes. You can also do that on Zoom. You can't. You can't see each other in the eyes. No, you can't. You have to sit and glow. You have your head up in your ass, Lars. You haven't noticed that you can't see each other in the eyes. No, I have my head her head in her zoom screen. You're always sitting there, I'm just talking in blue. The fact is that you never look at anyone. No, you should sit and look into the camera, and then it seems like you're looking into your listeners' eyes, but you're not. If you look into their eyes, it seems like you're looking away. So it's completely wrong. It's a small thing, but it means a lot to your trust. No, Lars! And what's exciting about these new technologies, which can give us the opportunity to ask ourselves why the big question is, should you want to get all these new technologies that are coming in other ways than they are? Isn't is now. And that's exactly it. It's a huge thing, also like Google's new glasses, which they are working on, where you can get real time translated when you're sitting and talking to someone. So you can sit and talk to someone who can speak a different language, and then you get it translated. Just like on TV, you get subtitles. We talked about it, because we think the whole world should listen to Supertrends. And that you can't just get your voice and then translate it into all languages and create a radio program that is just as good. There is probably some time before the humor and the cultural stuff. And that you can say what I just said in other languages. But now I'm pressing a button here and then we'll look far ahead. Against 2050, what do you think? I know that it hard and the challenge with the media is that it's a combination of a lot of technologies. I think it's great that we have Wi-Fi and science fiction movies, because it sometimes helps to give some pictures. But in the end, it's also people who who have to create it. So what is it we want to create for 2050? We have a teacher we can create. What do we want? And that's a gift. That's the beauty of working as a future researcher. You know we are also co-creators and it's the important questions we have to ask now, also in relation to development. Who should be allowed to control where we move? What are the worlds we want to move around in? Because yes, science fiction movies are fantastic at looking at potential developments in this. Will we have relations to these digital synthetic individuals that are in this. We see this in many different sci-fi movies, including Her, if anyone has seen it, which is also quite interesting because our feelings for these things, but we already have synthetic artificial intelligence, which some people think has human feelings, like Google. And that's really exciting to see. So, how do we ensure that we have a future in 2050 that we can like? And something else I could think of, is asking about 2050 2050 and maybe even Lars, will we have more identities? You talked about we should go to the psychologist because we are so happy for that superhero, we talked about that Norwegian boy, but can you reinvent yourself almost on a daily basis with a new avatar, new relationships, new relationships, new children, or are we bound to some kind of Iris recognition system because the actors who own this want to know who they are dealing with. They don't want us to change identity all the time and then there will be crime and shame. There are a lot of people out there right now, who are trying to force us to introduce ourselves. So that's what I'm excited about. Future identity is going to be insanely interesting to look at, and also this with... I think it's more normal to have more identities, but you know that it's one thing, but it's very natural to have different ones. You're not the same when you're with your son as you are when you're with your friends, as when you're at work. We already have different identities. And it's clear that there's just a much greater opportunity to express ourselves when we suddenly have the virtual layer on top. So I'm sure we will have different identities, and not just one, but many, for different purposes. Could you think of changing your identity, Lars? I would say it's true that you have different identities in your daily life and it's quite fun to cover that spectrum. But I have a question for you. I have noticed that Microsoft and Meta are very big players in this. But they also cooperate. They have made an agreement that you get access to Microsoft Business Suite, which is PowerPoint, Excel and Word and so on, in Meta. And I think, what does that mean? Does it mean that I can go up to a virtual platform and make my PowerPoint presentation, for example? You can already do that now, you can say in Meta Workspace. But of course, the better integrated it is. I have tried to make interviews also within these virtual worlds, in VR worlds, in Spatial, among other things, an interesting meeting platform to meet on. And I could not take my notes with me. I mean, I could not even, you know, my physical notes. And then it's not worth it to sit and do. It's not worth it, Lars. That's completely insane. But it's the new collaborations that are exciting to follow. Who is collaborating here? How much are these things actually... Because then it starts to make sense. You can actually sit in virtual reality with your virtual computer screen in front of you. And then you can already track a keyboard that is not there, but just sit and write on a virtual keyboard. Such things are really, really interesting to see when it becomes mainstream. And then it's not everyone who talks about a near hospital or access to health, do you think we will be placed on a meta hospital in 2050? First of all, I don't think we will be placed on a meta, if it's a meta Facebook we're talking about. Because it doesn't work that well with meta. But now we call you a metaverse. Yes, exactly. But a metaverse hospital. Yes, I would almost almost mean that in many ways. There is a lot of data that is being used instead of the physical. We are already on the way to say how we can register the changes that happen in our body in a much higher degree and see how we can both remove and operate. We seen, now that there are some siamese twins who have been separated, where there has been a surgeon in the USA, and then through virtual reality, has been with a physical doctor to separate them. We will of course do a lot of that, and that will make many more people in the world get access to the good experts. It will be very interesting to follow. Something I find exciting is that Maersk for example, they are doing their training in the metaverse, and for some reason, they are someone with very high character and are doing very well in school,. And then they get out on the ship, but in the metaverse. And then they find out that there are some people there, who are so crazy, that they will never ever get out on a real ship, because then they will kill others. And I think that's funny, because then we are out in the metaverse, giving some insights that we wouldn't have gotten on an exam table or something else. So we can practice and test through, but we can also be selected for our behavior out there in the real world. Lars, what do you think? I'll just go back to the idea of being admitted to a virtual hospital. And it's like, immediately when you say it, there's a self-contempt, because you don't want anything else to be admitted to a hospital. You can come to a more-person-room. Yes, with a remote view. We talked earlier about Digital Twin, which tracks what you do and then comes with guidance. But there is also the Meta University in the field of education, where you can experience, for example, you can train people to do operations, and there are not many people you can practice doing operations on, and then you can get some gloves on. So it feels like it feels to make a brain, with the feeling in your fingertips, to make an operation, while experiencing it in 3D. And then it's just that, when you can do it, you can also operate people who are in another part of the world. So in that way, it suddenly becomes extremely realistic, and the meta and reality melt together. And And if anyone would like to see some examples of this, I recommend that you go in and try to see some of the meta's ads from the time. They have a huge campaign going on, where you can see the possibilities of the future visualized. But their tagline, also called, The Impact Will Be Real. So no matter if it's virtual, but the impact will be real. And I think that's what we should look closer to, that it has a real impact on our reality, all these things that are happening right now. An extreme example is that they have developed a small robot room for American soldiers. So when they are wounded in the field, there is no hospital or medical facility. But they are picked up by a helicopter and then they are put in that room and then there is a helicopter somewhere in the south states of the USA, if I can imagine. And then they make these emergency interventions with the help of these robot pins. So it's also the same explosion of the two worlds. So it will save lives. Something I look forward to is all the colors, all the creativity. In a moment I can go in and create my own metaverse. I know that the young people already design their own game interface. But then I can say, there should be flowers on the walls and my grandmother should be on a huge picture. Because I often miss her. Maybe even animated, so she gives me that kiss look again and again. And then I go into my fantastic universe, and then I go in, and then we just don't have to end up in some dystopian reality, where we think, how boring it is. We want to take that with us and make some very cool buildings. I can't stop thinking about it. We were so boring back then. Where was our creativity? Where was our fantasy? Sofie, you have been involved in this with Darlige some of the others who are now coming, who are involved in democratizing creativity. And that, combined with the metaverse, must give an explosion of something special. It gives an explosion of something special, which we don't really know what it will be. But if you look at some of the new generative AI, that is, it's the artificial intelligence that has built on a lot of data points that have just been taken from the internet. And then you can write prompting, which is a word that will probably be big, you've probably already been on it. But this is where you just write what you want to have, and then you can either get a text, or you can get a picture, or you can actually also start getting video. And that's not far from where you can also get your virtual surroundings created from what you just say you want to have. And I think that form of creativity will give the individual almost a form of multiverse, as some people call it, because we have every reality we can deal with. And it's not just because we have the picture of your grandmother or other things and flowers in the virtual world. We will also have it as a layer in our physical world and can always change out. For example, if you climb a mountain range, you can put a real mountain in and real surroundings and make it much more exciting, entertaining and creative at the same time. Google has developed software that builds on the basis of what you are talking about. You show this software a picture and then it makes a 3D panoramic view into the landscape. That means it uses artificial intelligence to calculate what is around the corners and how it looks from the other side. So if you take a picture, I unfortunately like westerns, it has cost me a lot on the social front, but you take a picture from Tombstone, an old black and white picture, and then say, take me into that, and then suddenly the camera runs through the tombstone as the computer imagines the rest. Then you can say, okay, let what you just did become a part of my metaverse. And now I want to live in the tombstone. It's called outpainting right now. That you take something that is already there and then you can just continue. So you can also see already now that you can take an artwork and then artwork and ask the art intelligence to just expand this landscape. Can't you take a film like Avatar, which had huge, beautiful landscapes, and say, just build on that? I would like to live there. Sophie, I have to ask you something else. I'm very insecure, and I think the questions are the most important. So it's not because you have to be able to answer. But I think, are we more or less social? Because now I just came to think about it. I could well think, maybe in the metaverse, not that I don't hold on to Lars very much, but maybe I'll exchange him with Elon Musk. Not because Elon Musk would spend his precious time with me, but an algorithm will know more or less what he is going to say, how he thinks. So when I talk to him in Metaverse, he responds back like Elon Musk, with the same level of abstraction and wild ideas, then we become more social in the future or less social and with whom? That's a really good question and also one of them, just to go back to the Delphi, which is about to ask experts these very important questions and answers. And that is actually one of the questions we ask, it is the social. Because it is clear that it can go both ways, but I think that again, if we are able to create it, it will be more social, I think. It will be built on the basis of ... Yes, but with avatars or real people? A combination would be my best bet, because you are already talk about how you can re-experience dead people by putting all their data around them. But Salvador Dali, who has come to a museum where he stands like a hologram, and then you could ask him questions. There's also someone who created his dead daughter as an avatar, so she can meet her again. I think it gives new opportunities to get new connections to people, that aren't necessarily physical, but are built on algorithms that are based on their own knowledge. I have to say that if you want to hear more about being in different places at the same time, then you should listen to our Quantum program, because it's very basic. It tells the physicists how to be in different places at the same time. Lars, you are also standing with your fingers in the air. I just think that there are completely new disciplines coming into psychology because of this. We have already talked a little about it. But for example, the fact that you recreate your death. I think many psychologists would say that's a problem, because you have to learn to say goodbye and move on. So we get some opportunities that are not always good for us. Also because we change ourselves. What was okay to say 20 years ago is no longer okay. So you want to meet your deceased father-in-law. Now we may not have so much data, so we're far behind, but who suddenly says things that are not suitable for our time. These are elements. Should you then put an ethical layer over the extra filter? If we now choose to live forever, which already exists now, there are companies that say we can make you live forever in the metaverse. Do we want that? This has really been a program where we have thrown a lot of balls in the air with some crazy, exciting questions, and I will advise the listeners to make some scenarios at home, and then what you say about getting the tears wet. Not just reading about it, but having to try it because there is no doubt that it is really one of the technologies that will change the way we usually think. So when you talk about Web 3, it's not just that we went from blank paper to writing on the computer. We dropped thinking chronologically, because suddenly you could put things in a random row. And now we can almost design the whole universe with the power of thought. So it's just a lot more. And it's not just saying that it means something there and there, it means something everywhere. So it's really a program where it might be good to invite you back when the Delphi research is over. I would very much like that. So thank you very much to you. In the virtual metaverse there are galaxies of economic activity. The virtual economy is anchored in trade with virtual goods in virtual forums, often with virtual currencies, but typically with very real value. The markets are particularly driven by recreation and entertainment, such as when a buyer paid 170,000 dollars for a virtual cat killing in 2018, or when a 16-year-old boy from Denmark in 2019 earned 300,000 kroner on virtual embellishment in Counter Strike. But the trade with property and virtual land mass is coming after it. In 2022, Gucci bought a land in Roblox, which was visited by almost 40 million users. And the financial institute HSBC has bought land in The Sand sandbox with the wish to maintain virtual sports opportunities in the future. The WL has been traded for over 2 billion dollars in virtual land in the metaverse in the course of 2022. Well, Lars, are we going out with VR glasses and? I get so scared when I see that board. I'm not going to get out. What do you think about the investment potential? Is it something you can get started with? And there are also some who have arms over Kors, have made a joke video, I think it's called Icelandic Verse, which you can see on YouTube, where it's like, I actually like to go for a walk in the woods. Why the hell should I go for a walk in a virtual forest? Where he simply doesn't get it. And it's also funny, so there's also that, it will never be a scenario. I think you have to be very careful about making it so binary, either or. I feel very convinced that it will be really big, but when you listen to the experts, they are wildly disagreeing about what's going on, what is going to be the biggest and in which order and when. There is no doubt that, especially for entertainment-oriented, the technology is simply not very good yet. There are a lot of technological challenges. What the public noticed when Zuckerberg said that they would now give people legs in the metaverse. And that's of course because the equipment you equip yourself with only measures what the face and upper body do. So they don't know what the legs do. So you have to put the computer on and find out. I have to say that I have been on erotic meds in Valby, and I promise you that I had the lower legs with me. I actually tried to practice virtual sex. At first I thought it was a woman. I thought it was good in these gender-experimental times. Then I looked down and it was a ladyboy, a three-year-old ladyboy. And that was interesting, exciting. And the porn industry has always been very far ahead of this. It may be the one that gets the biggest first. What one? The porn-hunt in virtual reality. I can see a lot of business applications for me. But it's clear that there's a lot of money in gaming, and a lot of money in sim of physical things. And that's why the American military order for 22 billion dollars, it's for real. And before they made that order, they made a much smaller order and tested it with a lot of soldiers and were very happy about it. So it works for them. So there is definitely something going on there. Let's get started with our Lune Round. So is this a soft trend? So you have a choice if you are out there as a company or people say that you don't need to look at the next 10 years, or is it a condition, a hard trend, it comes, whether you want it or not, and you'd rather start now, or you'll get behind the dance. I think it's different, but if you're a real estate, then I think you can hardly live without it. But if you're a furniture store, you have to work with it. So it's very different. Depending on where you are. And if we look from a societal perspective, is it a nice to have or a need to have? I mean, it went so well without us? Well, you could say that society is now working without it, largely without it, so it's not something we need to have, but it will in a number of areas, make society more efficient, and especially you can save on physical travel and lots of physical activities if you can do them virtually instead. So in that way it is time and resources and savings and environmental benefits. We have a lot of energy transition programs and we have actually looked at saving 20% CO2 by working from home. And if it could be really attractive, I know that the IT industry is also a pig, but not to the same extent as if you were to take a plane. So I agree with you, if we look at it from CO2, then it might be need to and if not, it's nice. Will this happen slowly or quickly compared to the other trends we are looking at? I think this is one of those that will happen slowly first, and that means that at some point there are some killer apps that are completely gone, just like social media is completely gone on the internet. So we had the internet for a really long time, where the use of it grew quickly, but the activity on it per person exploded when you got certain killer apps. So we have to see those killer apps and then it's off all day. And Right now we see a lot of small shops that just start on the internet and work pretty well. I think it will be difficult or difficult to invest in. Is it not completely built to invest in it? Some of the already listed companies have invested a lot in it and if in that extent some of them really get something, then you can invest there. But otherwise it is a lot of venture capital activity. And I would just like to say that we talk about start-up companies that are market, and how they get into it. But ARK Innovation in the USA, which is... I've lost a lot of money on them. Many have, but they've made a lot of money before they lost a lot of money. But they have a project where they want to democratize the venture capital market, so you can invest down to 500 dollars and get in and out once a quarter, I think. And is this a small trend, an intermediate trend or a huge fanfare trend? We need to get the trumpetsets on, it's huge. So, it speaks for itself. Get started with the metaverse. It's already there. Instead of going out on your child who's playing games at home, get a pair of VR glasses or play with augmented reality next time you need to set up your living room. And then imagine how you can create value in your own work life. Dennis Riven, Lars Tvede and Lise Lotte Lyngsø.

This is Supertrends. The program where we are curiously investigating all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is future researcher Liselotte Lyngsø I am happy to be here. I have been looking forward to making this episode today, because it is about learning technologies. I recently saw an article in Forbes, where it was described that if you are under 5 years old, then you ask your mother and father about 120 things an hour. So you are very curious. And when you get to school, then you ask about one to one and a half questions in two hours. So we have done something completely terrible wrong. And today we will talk with our fantastic guest Ulrik Christensen, who is a medicine expert and has decided to revolutionize it and We need to look at a technology that might help us all. Lars, what did you think about going to school? I wasn't particularly motivated when I went to school. I was a good student at the time. But it was when I got out of the education system and out to work that it became clear to me how little I had used myself to get an education. And that was because when I got out of work, I had to learn a lot, which I had to use immediately after, just in time learning. And I found that so motivating, and then I could suddenly feel the contrast between that and what I had done for a really, really long time of my life. But I also found out something else. People have different ways of learning best. Some by reading, some by writing, some by talking, some by listening, some by doing. And unfortunately I am screwed up in such a way that I really have a hard a hard time listening. I have to read. So all the hours I sat on a bench and listened, it was almost a waste, because my thoughts just went somewhere else. And I really discovered how crazy it was when I came to Lampre University afterwards. And then I often sat down for lectures and relatively quickly they lost my attention, so my thoughts were everywhere. And then lectures are so long after lectures, that sometimes someone comes down to talk about something. And then I went down and said, that's my integral calculation, where you introduced that concept, you lost me. And that was because I didn't at all, my thoughts disappeared. Then the lecturer stands, and it's sometimes a place where there are 150-200 people attending lectures., and the lecturer explained it to me and looked me in the eye. And while he or she was doing it, my thoughts started wandering again. Oh no! And that means that people are very different in how they learn best. There is some data that shows that the curve of forgetting is universal. We have known it for many years. If you have sat through an hour's lecture, then within 24 hours you have already forgotten 70% and after 14 days, there is about 2% left. So something is so paradoxical about that we talk about education and it's just about teaching people to learn and why is it so badly screwed together if that's what it's about, then they should, if anyone, have control over it. It's completely messed up. Yes, and it reminds me of something I heard about. In high school, we had an enormously mature French teacher in third grade, and he told us that you have an enrollment rate and a forgetfulness rate,. He meant that our class as a whole had reached a stage where we forgot more French than we learned. He almost taught us the whole thing, and then there were totally hats and glasses in it. But apart from having a memory curve, there are ageing rates. And recently I read an investigation that showed that... How long does half of what you have learned become ageing and thus irrelevant? And then you say at the folk school, well, 25 years to half of what you have learned is irrelevant. If you go to university, then half is irrelevant after 10 years. But if you take a technical education, then it's three years. So if you take a five-year technical education, then quite a lot of what you have learned is already for your parents before you get your diploma. And that's worth thinking about. You should be in charge of lifelong learning. That we go from retirement to breaks and reorient ourselves throughout life. And it doesn't work. It's such a small percentage of us who move to another place. And if the boss sees you're taking a further education, they think, you're not tired enough, little friend. Yes, but it changes. There's an investigation I've read that says that Generation Z, the so-called Zoomers, who are born between 1995 and 2010, can expect to have six different careers and 18 different jobs on average. That means that you have to learn all your life. So it's a huge topic how to do it. And then the difference between people, which we were about before. Have you seen Ken Robinson's TED talk? It's the most popular TED talk ever. It's completely crazy. He talks about how creativity is often lost in the traditional learning system, which is a kind of industrial machine. He has an example of one called Gillian Lund. She was completely hopeless in primary school, and then her teachers sent a letter home to her parents, that something had to be done, because she was completely hopeless. Her mother then moved to the parents that something had to be done because she was hopeless. The mother then books a time with a psychologist and comes in with the daughter and then they have a talk with the psychologist. After some time he says to Jillian, to the girl, I want to talk to your mother in private, so we can go outside. He turns on the radio, where there is music. They go out and there is a window, where they can look into the room. He says to his mother, it's not because we are going to talk about something. We just want to see what she does. She gets up and starts dancing then he says to her, Jillian is not sick, she is a dancer. Jillian, she then goes to a ballet school, becomes very happy for it, later becomes a producer and choreographer, and instructs some of the most famous plays ever on Broadway and all kinds of other things and director at a mob show and dies at a very old age after a very happy and productive life in a form of a quarter billion kroner and it just shows that we are so different and that is also something that the education system should catch much better than it does. Yes, and that's what you have a hard time with if you sit one teacher and have such a class there on almost 30 students with different names and that's why we should talk about learning technologies today because that's what makes what makes us break the code. An investigation I think is very exciting, which we also have to talk about, is this that it is equivalent to how many there are in the class or if there is bad indoor climate. What matters is actually if you have a good teacher. And when you tell that story about her who went to the psychologist, then he is the good teacher who sees her dancing talent. And that's what the students report again and again. There was one who saw me. There was one who saw my potential, who gave me permission to be me. That was what made the difference. And I'm also very excited to hear in this program, can we strengthen that part with these technologies? How does the community fit in if we suddenly have to learn everything individually to our own adaptive side? You have to read, I have to listen, others have to see, someone has to feel. What does that do to society? There are a lot of exciting questions, but before that, I think we should listen to your Supertrends timeline. The SuperTrends machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, who, in combination with artificial intelligence, give a signal of when future groundbreaking technologies will be put to use. That's what it is. I have some some forecasts for our experts. One of them says that in 2025, artificial intelligence will be a market of 5.8 billion dollars. That's about 30 billion crowns. The important thing is that it will have a growth rate of about 45% per year. So artificial intelligence can help to catch the differences in how people learn and what they need to learn. For example, if you have an in-learning process where there is something you haven't understood, then artificial intelligence can catch it and maybe already calculate that you probably do not understand it and then take it. So the year after 2026, there is something called haptic illusion and virtual reality is used in medical education. So virtual reality is something where you wear glasses and then you can see something that is not right. But haptic illusion is when you have for example some gloves on and that gives you an idea of feeling something that is not there. And that means, for example, that you can imagine that you should feel how it is to operate on a person, even if there is nothing in the person. 2030, then there is this combination and what is called, in all, what is called Extended Reality, where you use artificial sensors and 3D glasses and so on, that it becomes mainstream, especially in medical education. And there is more about medical education, because at the same year we expect to have digital agents to help with the teaching. Then there is one that is quite radical, 2034, that for the first time there is a robot that is a university lecturer. And what some have thought about, they have said that this robot will be able to do multitasking, so you can send an email to it, which it answers digitally while it is teaching. Then it knows what has been asked about and can then get a high grade in the teaching. So it is not completely uninteresting. And then there are some who say that... If there are email students at that time, do you think so? Yes, or whatever it is. You can have a dialogue with it while it is teaching and then it understands where the school is pressing. And then there are some who say that in 2039 you will also start to see it in public schools. And then in 2041, a long time out, there are some who think that using these virtual reality glasses is very common in public schools, so in general education. And then they say, for example, that the students can sit and watch a digital three-dimensional reconstruction of the old Rome, or they can see a piece from Shakespeare being played at the London Globe Theatre around 1600 or they can be with astronauts on a trip to Mars. I can remember in my history lessons it was quite difficult to control the timeline and chronology. Imagine being able to walk down the dusty streets of Copenhagen as an avatar and visit a sick little child in the bed and see what they ate and maybe smell the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the smell of the how much it smelled when the cloacas weren't made. It must be a completely different way to absorb information and thoughts than we have today. Or we come to think back and think, God, how primitive we were. Think that people caught anything at all. Apart from Lars, who can read and teach. Then we have in 2022, it's been a while, but still within reach, that it will be common that teachers, that is, the biological teachers, that they are more mentors than teachers. That is that you get the main part of your teaching from computers, with 3D glasses and everything else. And then you have a conversation with the teachers. At the same time, you also need what is called a flip in the teaching. You get get homework first, which the computer helps you with, and then you come in and work on project tasks where the teacher is present, where you use what you have learned beforehand. And then you have turned it around in relation to how you are today. And then we always have some psychedelic people and in 2050 the first class will open on Mars. So that should happen. I don't really know about that. But then in 2050, there are also some who expect that there will be more who are being taught at home than who are taking part in a formal school. And maybe we shouldn't learn anything because we get some kind of brain implants. I know that there have been some experiments on mouses already where you can make experiences. A normal mousse takes takes three weeks to find a cheese in a labyrinth. And then you take this chip, it has had a memory chip, you take it out of the head on the mouse, throw it into a fresh mouse, fresh from the fad, and then it fizzles into the cheese as if it had been there a thousand times before. So if you can do it on a mouse, you can maybe do it in 2050 on humans. According to Forbes and the learning platform Thinkific, this is the most important trend in digital learning in 2023. Nano-learning. It is a trend that takes the lead in enlightening hubs on social media such as TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, where video content of between 30 and 60 seconds not only entertains, but also educates and even makes us want to learn more. Just like when Netflix makes us want to watch an episode. For the same reason, there is a tendency among influencers and content creators where less talk about themselves and more try to transfer knowledge to their followers. It pays off. I have a guest who knows a lot about learning technologies. Tue Nielsen from Smart Learning. He's in Nansen Street at CBH Business Academy and helps business academies throughout Denmark to become more intelligent and understand how technologies are used to turn education, as we know it, upside down. And I know he has had a lot of teachers who are a little worried when they hear what he has to say. But what are some technologies that change what we usually do most? And welcome to... much. We are starting to see some incredibly intelligent, what can we call them, chatbots, Large Language Models, that's what it's called professionally. And they can solve a lot of the tasks we have in the school system. They can write styles, essays, they can solve math tasks, they can write computer code. They can do a whole range of things. And how do you get them to do that? It's very easy. For example, you can say, I would like computer program written in JavaScript, which gets a ball to jump around on the screen. Then it generates the code for it. But that's what you learn when you learn to program. Yes. That's what everyone got to know. Now they have to learn the code. Yes. But there is no reason for that anymore. There still is, because they sometimes make mistakes, and then you have to be able to find those mistakes. That's right. So how should you teach in the future, do you think, if the computer can handle most of it? Then we have to have some completely new skills. Before, it was perhaps that the focus was on writing this code. But now you have to learn more than that. Because now you have to understand both how the code works, but you also have to understand how to generate it automatically, so you can get up to speed in what you produce. And now you only need two things. So try to explain me a teaching process in the future, where you think these technologies are in. Yes, many times you ask people to describe how democracy works or something like that. And you can go into a chatbot and get it to write fast. But then it's a bit exciting. What can you do? You also need to know how to fact check what this chatbot is doing. And you also need to understand that it doesn't say it has taken all the information with it but that you want to be involved. And then you need to be able to add things and remove things. And then you might need to be able to adapt the language so that it hits the target group and maybe it needs to be a bit of humor. So is that a future exam you just described there or are there exams in the We hope that this can help to get rid of the exam. No one has ever liked the exam. Teachers don't like it, students don't like it, universities don't like it because it costs a fortune. It's just a really bad idea. So there should be another way, and we have many suggestions on what that could be. But it should be abolished. But isn't it also a huge gift that you get your own personal mentor or trainer who knows almost everything? It's fantastic, because we know how children have a lot of questions about life. And they can ask this chatbot about all kinds of things. How is it with Jupiter? And what if you were there now? And so on. And not always your parents know that. And the same applies to the fact that the school system doesn't always have the answers to the interests you have. I have always admired Alexander the Great. He had an aristocracy as a house teacher. He knew so much about so many things. And they could go there and talk together and he could shape Alexander the Great. He also became a mighty ruler because he had such good teaching. And the same could happen to us if we have such good teachers in chatbots and in real people, then we will get far. Thu, you just said he could shape Alexander the Great. Is there a danger here that these systems, it's education, I know there are other countries, China for example, where you mix in what the children should learn, there are filters coming in and some stories we shouldn't talk about and so on. It's also a huge superpower to have. On the one hand, there is a democratization, because we all get to learn something, even though we have very stupid parents. And on the other hand, is it a one-way street that we will see of learning? What you need to understand about this is that their knowledge is built up, all the knowledge that people have accumulated. And what can you say, if shit comes in, shit comes out. And that's just the way it is. So they are problematic in all kinds of ways, because they can have listened to sources on the internet that are completely out of line and they can also come to put facts wrong together and as I said, there could also be filters in for governments that don't want to talk about everything. So yes, it's very problematic, but you just have to understand that we can't stop it. There is a report about a king of Denmark called King Knud. He sat at a certain time by the sea on his throne chair in his fine clothes and ordered that the tidewater should not make his clothes wet. But of course the tidewater came as always and made him wet. So we can't stop these things. We can only moderate them and shape them according to our wishes. Moderating and shaping is a cue for me to adapt. That individualized learning. The teacher who understands if I'm tired at 8 in the morning and I get fresh when it's 11 in the morning and suddenly I am motivated to learn something but also helps me to become more aware of what I know and don't know. How far are we with that, Tu? We have started to make adaptive systems and they are very useful because they keep in touch with what you know and what you don't know. They teach you specific things you don't know or things you are not aware of. They have a certain amount of material in them, so when you use these systems, you end up in the same place. You have mastered the knowledge that is in the system. The crazy thing about the new chatbots is that there is no end to the material they have. They can lead you in all possible directions and in very, very large depths. And that will give it a new dimension. And beyond that, the exciting thing is that you write down the systems you use. These you can talk to very quickly. It's already seen in beta versions and chatbots. And in the long run, and now we're looking 5-10 years into the future, you will have an avatar that might look like a person, a sympathetic person that is interested in you, who has this dialogue with you about these exciting things. So that will be your best friend in school, that will be the person you always get to look at. You know, you want to have a side man you to look at the person you want to have as a sidekick. And that becomes the perfect avatar. What do you think about whether we should still go into a classroom and do this or should we do it when we need it? Have you thought about this? Because it looks like a factory that the kids go into in the morning and home in the afternoon, and it also applies to further education. If there is something that looks like factories, then it is an existing school system. They remind me of factories in many ways. But people are social beings, so we should always learn in collaboration with other people and with living teachers and so on. It will not change. But sometimes we learn alone. And if you have teenage children and see how long they spend on YouTube, you will know that they learn a lot alone. We will continue to do that. It would be great to have a good teacher in that universe. Can we imagine getting some more social education with these new technologies? Well, they can teach us about the values and tell us about the benefit of social education. But social education should be taught in practice and that will not change. So if we look really far ahead, what will be the wildest thing when we look back and think back and really look back on that time many years ago? What is it we tell the next generation about the things we did and what do we do completely differently? Well, as we have now become accustomed to not remembering our phone numbers and our contact information because we have them in our phones, then there will be a lot of knowledge we do not allow ourselves to remember all the time, but which we just ask our chatbot about and then it will update us and tells us what we need to know in that situation. So our skills are more about how we use the chatbot and not so much about going and remembering all the world's knowledge right now and here. Do you think we will be loud and deaf or will we become mega smart? That's a good question. I think it can go both ways. It depends on how we use the opportunities we have. If they are the right people who are involved in the development or not. So what is it really that we should learn in the future? In the future we should learn to master these co-pilots that we have in life. We will learn to use them as we have learned to use the speed pilot in the car and that kind of thing. We will be very good at it, there is no doubt about it. The only problem is of course that many of these are owned by tech companies and many of them are developed only in large countries, USA, China and so on. So it would be nice if there was something that was open source and in public domain and that we had influence on and that could be formed in a more humane than commercial direction. Thank you very much, Thu. It was really exciting to hear your thoughts on these learning technologies. Thank you for being here. Now I have really looked forward to introducing Ulrik Juel Christensen, who is the director of a learning technology company called Area 9 Lyceum. He sold a part of the company a few years ago to McGraw Hill and he is still the director of the area 9 and he is passionate about learning technology. Ulrik, you are on a line from Boston. Welcome to the studio. You have heard our gossips, timelines and so on. Can you tell us with your own words what learning technology is in its size? Learning technology includes all the things that make the people in our system today able to deliver value and interact. Therefore, I think that with the risk of sounding a bit backstabbing, I think there is too much focus on fancy technologies in this time line, compared to the technologies that I think will really move some substantial things. And underneath this, you are already working with Flip Classroom today, you just don't need a robot to answer the questions, because a teacher can do that. And then you discuss whether to flip classrooms with technology or not. But technology that allows teachers to cross the limit where they can flip a classroom, is technology that is much more accessible and has a much greater impact. We don't have to wait for a human professor to produce questions. Ulrik, explain to the listeners what Flipped Classroom is. Flipped Classroom means that you turn what's happening when are together with your teacher. You prepare beforehand, and then the teacher focuses the time you have together on the places you could not learn on your own. And the fundamental observation behind it is that you spend a lot of time learning on your own in most of the learning systems. When you do homework or when you are sitting in class and one teacher talks to 24-30 students, it is also that you are a bit overloaded with yourself. You have to try to process it yourself. You are not actively engaged in it. If you could concentrate the time you have with a teacher who can adapt, who is able to adapt in a very advanced way, you would be able to reach longer with the same teachers. And you could probably make it more interesting to be a teacher. Instead of repeating a lot of things you have taught 25 times before, it is the same as you did the last 25 times. You are constantly challenged to what are the challenges of the students ahead of you today? What should What should we do? How do we meet them where they are now? That's what Lars is talking about, about adaptivity. Who is in my class? I am sitting at home and learning to divide. I remember learning to divide. I didn't get to go to bed with my dad before I learned what I think I was up all night and I coughed and threw up my hair. So I imagine myself, I would like to get this pedagogical system today that helped me to break the curve from what I have. And where does the teacher come in? Is it then community oriented or is it a form of coach who has to give me courage and give me a kick with breaking the code? How does it come in, Ulrik? I think the technologies that come into effect will affect our world in a completely different way. For example, a teacher will of course have a very significant importance in relation to the super complex, and this is very complex, there is every form of interaction between people. It would be very difficult to imagine that a robot would be able to do it anytime soon. As an example, I heard an example of something that is completely unthinkable, that you can get artificial intelligence to do in advance, is to go into a remote home and make a cup of coffee. It is such a complex thing that all people, largely in the whole world, can solve, but AI is far from solving. And that means, there are some things that AI and robots will be fantastically good at, and some things that they will not be good at at all. For example example, giving a meaningful hug to a student and telling them how it should be done. That's where I think your background is very interesting, Ulrik, because you are also a doctor. So one thing is to be able to make diagnoses and say you need to use this and that. Another is to be able to read the whole person and take a starting point in where they are, just that day and just in that situation. And that's a little bit what the teacher should be able to do, but also the community that should be strengthened. But try to explain to me, what are the learning technologies can do? And what are you testing in Area 9 for example? What we have been working on for many years is, how do you make sure that you don't get angry at the dividend problem you have? Or for that matter, in a more modern environment, you probably wouldn't have as many calculations as you did before, but you can start to calculate how you best make a use of spaghetti. So you have to make a calculation of how thick it should be. Hopefully, much faster than the time we are talking about here, you will see a change in the way that learning is about using your knowledge and less about going through a lot of exercises. The traditional industrial setting we have for learning is about having a lot of students through a system with a limited amount of learning time. And therefore it is all set up after this machine we have built. The problem is that it is not particularly good for meeting students where they are, and it is not particularly good to create the skills that we are looking for now, which are about collaboration, critical thinking and creativity. That means that if you have that type of challenge, that type of goal, then you have to implement the teaching in a different way. And it's not a robotic teacher who has the answer to that. It's a question of finding the interaction between knowledge and skills, or knowledge and skills, or knowledge and skills of other forms, so that you can actually reach these far more advanced things. And I think the timeline is much, much shorter. The OECD for the PISA test in 2030 is about these modern things. It's not about being. And that means that all countries that do not want to look totally stupid at the OECD PISA test, will have to start to relate to how we are managing our schools differently. And that is where technology can make the resources necessary for teachers to spend their time more to create circumstances where people can practice in these things, make projects. Some of the things that are on Lars' timeline, the timeline in Lars' presentation, of course, there is no doubt about it, it is important, I just think that it can, first of all, happen much faster, and secondly, there are other places where technology will play a role below role in helping the students when they need to learn something they don't know in advance. There is no need for a teacher to do it one-on-one, but technology can help in learning some of the more basic things. So I think technology will have a completely transformative influence on the more mechanical part of learning, which will still be important in the future. Because you can't completely stop being able to multiply two two-digit numbers in your head, because that's what you need as a doctor, for example. Yes, when you read, I also need you to have a basic education in terms of knowing anatomy and knowing where the different knots are and maybe even what they are called. And what about all that with the forgetfulness curve? Is it just because it's all new anyway or is it something that comes into it? That we spend a lot of time on repeating what we thought we knew instead of what we didn't know. So all that with what is it I don't know, I don't know, I can't deny? What should I ask about? All those fields. What do you think about that, Ulrik? There are two things that are important here. Ebbinghaus' study of the memory curve are about non-related things. It is important to keep an eye on these things. If you learn something and it is not in a meaningful connection, then you forget it quickly. Therefore, it is very positive to say that if we can create meaning in things, it will be hanging much longer. And the more meaning we can create in what you learn, the longer it will be hanging. That's relevant. I remember things if it has to do with my work as a future researcher. And Lars remembers that if it has an investment potential, it sets itself up, because it has relevance in the situation. So we go from a if and maybe learning to a just-in-time micro-learning. Is that something you see? It applies in contextualizing and creating a semantic connection between what you're learning. You can tie the knots together so you remember them as a knot. Then you'll remember it much longer. But the more relevant it is, the more it is about what you are interested in. We know that this leads to a much longer impact on the learning you have. Elon Musk once said that learning is the same as downloading data and algorithms down to the brain. And that one of the reasons why classroom teaching can be so ineffective is that it is a download of data and algorithms on an extremely slow pace. According to him, the future of learning is therefore radically different. For example through a brain implant, which he himself works with in the company Neuralink. Neuralink is a so-called brain-computer interface, which, according to Elon Musk, will strengthen the neuroplasticity in the user's brain for optimal learning and give people access to all available knowledge on the Internet with minimal latency. In December 2022, Musk demonstrated how a monkey with a brain implant uses a computer at the expense of his mind. Ulrik, if we could create creative destruction, destroy all the educational institutions, as we have today, have rebuilt the building. Would you like to look at 2050 and say, what would your big dream be? How would it look like? I think you should turn your head where you start and what is on the focus. You have to think about where you start and what creates the focus. You have to start with the individuality first. You have to start by saying that if it is the meaning barriers that make this a sustainable effect, then that is where we should start. We have the problem that historically we have believed that if we just send the children out in rubber boots and raincoats and the teacher brings an acoustic guitar under an apple tree, then at some point they will learn what they should know. We know that doesn't happen. So we need to find another way to create these conditions. One of the things we want to say is that we can trust that technology can learn to divide. If technology says that you are something there and someone else needs to spend ten times as much time on it, that's also okay. So people, there are things where we say we're doing something, but this variability is caused by letting technology help. Not to overdo it, but to help. But in return, when we meet in school, when we meet in these social contexts, these more complex contexts, which are completely dependent on us maintaining a relevance as humans in relation to robots, then I think you should start somewhere else and say, now we need to create something with what we've learned. Now we need to use it for something. Now we need to practice that what we've learned actually worked. I'm writing a book called Mastery, which is about mastery learning. It's not about becoming a master, or about doing something that is good enough to meet the needs. We need to start with creating things, we need to have this creativity, we need to have this goal with learning. And then we need to say, there might be some holes to be closed afterwards. And I think technology will be the one to close those holes. So that we meet about the big cool things and we can create something. And then during that process, while you are trying to find out how to create a new business, for example. If there are people who a new home, they need to find out the statistics for how many people can do this. And then you learn algebra. Then you can divide the time as part of it. It's not guaranteed that you have learned everything you need to know when you are done. But then you can use technology to be a leveling technology or a leveling tool, which says, we'll just close the rest of the holes until the end. But instead of having 10 years of third-year learning, where you get brainwashed through, I'm not saying we do it in Denmark, but some teaching systems do it, where you get brainwashed through times and divider and staves and things like that, then you start the other way around starts and we follow the holes afterwards. So it's a change of effect, a bit like if you take a golf player, it's a mix of going to the driving range and playing on the grass. Yes, and that means that the exams we have today, which could be about the anatomy the anatomy, will be cancelled. Because then EdTech, education technology or learning technology, will simply monitor you and know that you can do what you can. So there is no reason to go to the exam. There are many days that the exam is anxious. Because it's about that it has measured you along the way and you and now you have control over it. In return, you have to do something useful in the exam. Show that you have used your learning to something that gives meaning to others. Could that be a new scale? Yes, especially for yourself it should make sense. It should be something you burn for. You have to find something... No, but now it's my money that goes to it, so I would like it to make sense for me if I have to pay for it. I do not refuse to pay for someone who makes, what do I know, cupcakes or something. But it's the process that counts. So it doesn't really matter if they learn the method of making cupcakes. The fact that cupcakes are an excuse for learning a scientific method or an experimental method. So we can be much more liberal than we think we can be. And what is important is that we have shown that these formative systems, systems that monitor you while you are learning something, it's been ten years since we broke that down. We know for sure that we can trust these systems. So it's interesting now, and it's also what we are researching now, how do we make these circumstances so that people can learn the difficult things. When you fail, it's actually a way to the goal. So when you fail later in life, you don't see it as a downside, but as the next step towards success. Two very different ways to see a failure. I have a question. If we imagine the ideal scenario, so we have a class and we have someone like Gillian, who is a talented dancer and choreographer. And then we have Lars Lesebog, it's not me, but someone who can't move his body at all, but who is brilliant at mathematics. And then there is a teacher who has to gather them about some projects. It's complicated if you open up for all the different things. And they may also learn the same thing at a very different pace. How does that work? We have also tried that in 30-40 years and not didn't work. The problem is that if you try to do this with the amount of learning time we have today, the teachers will burn out. It works in the most ambitious and well-off schools. There are schools that do this all over the world. But they are totally different. It's like 8-koture clothes. So what is important is what is different between the 8-koture clothes and the stang clothes. Because we need to find a way to make stang clothes that everyone can enjoy. And what needs to be done is that we need to find a way to focus the teachers' time on the difficult, not the trivial. It's a difficult discussion to have with teachers, because a significant part of their identity is to do homework. A year ago, I met a teacher who said that she would never say that the students had to hand out a handwritten note because she would correct it when she was sitting in her flat with a cup of tea. And I think that's what will have to change in the future. The role of the teacher will be really divided into a much more advanced role, which I hope will be much more interesting, but a role where the teacher is the facilitator and where the teacher is the one who orchestrates the learning. But the students are much more active, because you have to be aware that it is actually not so difficult to create some of these conditions, even if you could guarantee the logistics of the chaos. As a teacher, it's more chaotic. But that's how it is with people. You can learn a lot of project-based things, like place-based learning. Things like throwing students out of school, they go out into the real world and work there and come back and have learned some things. This interaction, I know it works well, it's just incredibly difficult to escalate because the teachers are burning out. It requires a lot of teacher resources. But you have to learn a lot of it. What technology can do is make it realistic and scale the experiments that have been done. For example, if you have six groups of four students, it is super difficult for a teacher to monitor if they are sitting six different places in the school. Whereas if you could get insight into what the hell are you doing, where is the chain going to jump off, this is where I should focus my efforts. In China, for example, you have some kind of pattern recognition cameras that can see when the students zoom out and give. I have four children, I had some at a school where you could walk across three class lines, so you could always find the level and they worked in a project oriented way but suddenly it turned out that it was in third grade my son hadn't been to a single math class anywhere in any class for a year he had been out on the skateboard which he has become very good at it. But Ulrik, these teachers should have figured out that he had zoomed out too long ago. Because these children don't always know if they are interested in cupcakes or in being dancers or something that fits into those areas. So how important is it with those communities? That's also what I wanted to ask you about, because all the research we look at when you are investing in companies and all kinds of things, it's not individuals, it's groups of people who can do something fantastic in collaboration. And a lot of this makes it possible to work individually. But what about our connection and our acceptance that people are different? Where does this move you towards 2050 in your ideal school future scenario? Well, that is actually my prediction, the same as yours. I think it is imperative that we move towards collaboration and group structure. But it does that the individual learning, we have to remove the focus of the teachers. Okay, so all the individual work is going elsewhere and the school is not necessarily a physical space, but a social project, or a collective, productive space. So we have to think away from the boundaries and think about what kind of joy is being broken in collaboration. Who is allowed to choose whether it is cupcakes or high-heels? I hope the students get that. The most important motivator is to let people have an influence on their own everyday life. What is your biggest insecurity? It's been serious enough to solve this problem. I think we are over the fact that the way we have learned to do it, will soon become obsolete and not have the meaning we hope it will have. Therefore, what I think should happen is that we should learn the things we do anyway when we grow up. I think we will manage to control the children's learning. I think the teachers will quickly, even though it's slowly starting, I think the teachers will quickly switch. But I think the adult learning, and the people who will survive 30-40 years more in the labour market without becoming irrelevant, I hope we will reach a way where we can make it a part of what we do anyway. So we learn from what we do when we go to work, when we execute our jobs, but when we build learning into it. Because that is probably the only real clue on how to solve this. One of the things I experience in companies right now, and especially the new hybrid situation, is that they lose the employee's sight. And can these learning technologies be used to make it possible to follow up on who needs help? Because we are very bad at asking for help. And your school would have known that with your son's mathematics, if they had booked formative systems, i.e. systems that help you to keep an eye on whether you are on the right track. Should you have more time? Should it be in a different way than we do? So the systems that help to adapt to the individual are also very, very sensitive-tuning instruments that can measure very early and say, oh, there's something wrong there. It may be the right thing to do on the skateboard, but then let's agree that it's the skateboard we're doing right now. Then it might be that we could do some math exercises that are about skateboarding. The coolest thing that comes back to the teachers in these more modern teaching situations is that they think, shut up, how cool it is to see the creativity the children show. And you think, that stupid thing, I didn't do it myself. So if the teachers had defined that now the teachers had to put on plastic that worked in the swimming pool or could be put on underwater, then it could well be a completely different task they had set. And that's why I think that... You see the schools where this works, and the experimental environments where it works, that it's quite inspiring to see. And I think it's a fun way to be a teacher in the future. And it's much less from teacher to student, and much more a collaboration between them. Thank you very much, because you took the time to talk with us all the way from Boston, and I wish you all the best and good luck with revolutionizing learning and teaching as we know it. It is an area that is in rapid development, and now we have to look at the investment potential. Thank you very much for being with us, Ulrik. There has been a rampant fight among numerous educational institutions and teachers since December 2022, where the advanced language model chatGPT became publicly accessible because children and young people can use the technology to write their reports. Others see ChatGPT as a language-based counterpoint to the handheld calculator, which is also a controversial learning technology that many thought was too effective as a tool, as it was introduced in the 1970s. But the calculator was accepted and expanded globally. It makes it possible to make calculations faster and more precise. Students use it as a way to understand complex formulas and concepts. Now many teachers are not just focusing on the result, but on how the students use technology to reach their goals. Well Lars, it really is an area of education that has not been particularly competitive. And in any case, when you ask future researchers around the world, and they have to point to one area where there are these so-called fat cats, that is, something that has been allowed to just hang. I am in the administration of an educational institution, I can say it that it's totally taboo to tell a teacher that it's not possible. You have to move on. We can talk about all sorts of other things. Can learning technology, do you think that's what's fixing this? I understand that it's one of those things. You have a mixture of areas in life where technology just stops and suddenly you can do something you never dreamed of. And then there are other areas where you think, why isn't it getting better? I often think about the experience of booking a medical consultation and then graduation. It's two areas where you think, why won't they get on? And it's about folk school, it's about further education, business education, but also about learning through life and also how organizations help their employees to learn. So it's a huge area. You could say that on some international level there is competition between universities. You have those commercial private universities that typically are at the top of the ranking. But otherwise there is not much competition, no. There are some experiments with charter schools and private schools versus public schools, but it's going surprisingly slowly. And that's maybe because we need to support some communities. It's not enough just to sit at home. We have to go out, we have to go out and meet others, we have to go out and solve some challenges together. And maybe it's right, as you say, that it needs to be integrated much more into the workplace. So what you can say is that there is clearly, and it is highlighted in this conversation, that there is really good research and software is being developed for it, with really good research in psychology, in learning. There is something that you have seen works well is for example in Singapore where you have the in-teachings, something that responds to the proportion of students in Denmark, where you have quality circles and take those who have the best results as teachers and they then get an assignment to go from school to school and see how they do it and then talk to them about how to do it better. So a process that simply aims to always increase the effect of what you do. And of course with children, so of course you are afraid to experiment with children. It doesn't help at all in time. But so much talent and so much time is spent on it that it's not optimal. And then we talked about my son before, so now I think I'm completely family-sneezing, but there is a lot that makes the old systems no longer work. We have algorithms, so it is possible to find a computer generated answer to almost any question you can get out there. And otherwise you have to buy a piece of meat to do your homework your homework. So there is no other way but to feel motivated if we want to learn something. Or else there are some who jump over where the children are low. So there is a huge pressure on educational systems in relation to that they should, because otherwise we get what is called school hacking, that is, we go out and put together what we need to use ourselves elsewhere. So in that way, there will be increasing competition. But now we're going to take a look at the investment potential and if this is a big or small trend. I think it's a very big trend. When we say big or small, it's something that fills me, but it's also something that is important. And I think this is top important for society and for every individual. It's important for national economy, and it's within what the venture capital industry calls edtech, that is Education Technology. And there are probably also really big investment opportunities in the right solutions. And I got to know Ulrik in the briefing that it's totally Wild West. He says there are a lot of people out there who say we're doing EdTech, and then they don't have as much substance. So it's obvious that it's something that many can call themselves. Yes, he doesn't like to be called that because there are too many broken cars. So therefore learning technology. I want to hear from you Lars. So you mean if we ask you nice or need to have? Need to have. And is it something that comes slowly or quickly in relation to the way we usually do things? I think slowly. I also think it's infinitely slow. I thought it was completely different already now. But it's getting better and better now Now my youngest is 12 years old. I have to say that from the age of 12 to the age of 25, a lot has happened. And fortunately in a positive direction, as far as learning is concerned. Is it difficult or expensive to invest in? It's not super expensive. It's not something where you just go into your computer and find something to invest in. And if I say rich, sustainable or clever, what do we get most of? It has to be clever. And we get rich. It's something that can be seen on BNP if you educate and train your population. And you think this is a big supertrend. I'm really happy about that, because then I have to press the show button. It's big. Thank you for listening to this episode about learning technologies. It's a broad landscape that is both about empathy with humanity, how we strengthen community, creativity, creativity, so we can do something else than the robots. And then there is a lot of doubt about how that timeline can look like, because we all thought that the future would come much faster, and then it didn't come anyway. It is an area that everyone agrees on, there must be something done here, because it can be seen on the bottom line and it can be seen on people's joy of life if they learn and train all their life through. So keep your eyes open for these trends and remember if you like this, then ask us finally on social media and share the show. Thank you for listening to this episode of Supertrends. If you have comments, questions or suggestions, you can write to us on social media. Remember to share and like. The hosts of the show were Dennis Riven, in the studio were Lars Lise Lotte Lyngsø.

Then I get some white powder that I have to sprinkle on my yogurt every morning. Then I eat my yogurt drink and sprinkle that powder on, and then I become completely ecstatic afterwards, and then people think it's cocaine. These cost-effects in scientific experiments look like they could promote the spread of some forms of force, and they don't help with all the other things they should have helped with. Our very poor children will live through this for 150 years. This is Supertrends, the program where we inquire about all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your worth is a future researcher at Lotte Lyngsø, and every week she is flanked by investor, author and creator behind Supertrends, Lars Tvede eternal life? I do. But when I talk to people about it, there are quite a few who don't want it. But I think it would be fantastic, because then you can relax more. I think I have a little bit of a phobric in my life, there are so many things I want to achieve. So if I knew it was endless or close, I would say I could actually think about becoming a trumpet player. I could think about one thing or another. There is a lot of time for it all. Don't you think we would be like those doves, that there wouldn't be anything that was important if we always lived and lived long? Why do you think people say they don't want to live long? I think they think they enter a room full of holes. And then there are some who say that if their friends and loved ones die while they live, it would be terrible. But we are talking about technology that will be available to everyone at some point. Yes, there are many fish in the sea, or whatever it's called. That too. And Lars, what do you do to live long? Is it just something you read about? Because I have seen a study with people who have been told that if they don't put their life on the line, for example if they lose their life to avoid having heart problems, then it is still something like one out of ten people actually manage to do it. So we use a lot of time to talk about that we want to live longer, but very few can actually deal with it. Are you one of those who deal with it, or do you just say it? I deal with it to some extent, but I have for many years, almost my whole life, had to do sports and keep a special weight. If I get spaghetti balls in my nose, I don't eat much spaghetti. And I don't smoke, but I drink alcohol. But a few years ago I met a doctor in Switzerland who is a coach doctor who actually helps you to live a longer health span. So this doctor has made a program for me. I get a pretty big blood test, almost an overworkout, say. Twice at least. And then it's sent to Berlin and tested for 200 different things. And then it's like a dashboard. And then he came back and said that I lack B12 and D in the winter. So vitamins. And then I take that. And then something that is generally preventive for inflammation. I actually have quite low inflammation in my body, but it is very important and it is a natural medicine against it. And then I get some white powder that I need to sprinkle on my yogurt in the morning. And then drink my yogurt and pour the powder on, and I become ecstatic afterwards. And then people think it's cocaine. But it's not. I become ecstatic because I've already had 5 cappuccinos. No, this is some kind of bacterial powder to get the optimal blood flow, which turns out to. There are 3 kg of blood flow that is carried around, and it is like an organ, which is super important. I think it is extremely interesting. There has been a huge explosion in our... We have gone from inpatient to home inpatient. We have all received our own home hospital. And it just gets wilder with all the data we collect. There has been a growth in these smart weeks in the last few years of 158%. And we have these old people who can't go to bed without they have walked their 10,000 steps. And what I also find very exciting is the inequality in health. Those who are in the forefront are doing really well and have expensive racing bikes, these middle-aged men in Lycra who are driving even more turbo on themselves. And then we have another group that falls even more behind in the dance. It was more because you said in the future we will all join in the long life. We should ask Niklas about that. Yes, it is common for everyone, but it is very different how people would use it. What I can read up to is that with the genes we have today, we think that the maximum life span is 120-150 years. But we will probably talk with Niklas about what is realistic for ordinary people in the next 10 years and what will happen in the long run. Think about if you could think of an eternal life, we are back with a timeline of when you will die and how long you will have to keep the balls together without dying, so you will be able to join this wave. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, which in combination with artificial intelligence gives a clue to when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. Lars, when, when, when can we reach it? When you die, when I die, I'll follow you. And I'm a woman, and women live a little longer than men, right? Yes, it's deeply impossible. I've looked at the Supertrans machine and we have all these prognoses from different experts, who are both entrepreneurs and researchers within anti-aging. I just want to read some of the things we see on this timeline. So in 2023, it's very soon, one can say, there is expected to be a very effective way to measure the total level of inflammation in the body. It is very important. I mean, I already get that measured today, but it should get better. And there is absolutely no problem in drinking. The finger rules I know are the cramps rules, i.e. fasting, smoking, alcohol, motion and sleep. And that alcohol, is it good to drink a little? It's a little individual. So you must like it. I don't think it's good for your health. In 2024, it was to be approved in the USA and get a treatment that I know you have tried, Liselotte, which is NAD+. Yes, I would like to tell you about that. I was in South Africa, in Cape Town, and then I went into an IV bar. As a future researcher, it is important to go into bed with the future. That is, try everything you can at all without putting too much life on the line. An IV bar, what is that? Well, that's it. You go in, there is some kind of meditation music and everyone sitting there looked completely young. Then you get a bag, a sy a syringe and you can order NAD and all kinds of minerals. You put it in your arm and get an intravenous hose. It takes an hour for this liter of magic to run into my arms. And then you sit and drink your coffee at the same time and have fun. I was at all kinds of meetings, so just the placebo of being allowed to sit with my legs up for an hour was really cool. And then I was in a warm place, so I got lots of water in my body. But I I think it was like getting something fantastic in. But the idea is that with that NAD, as far as I know, NAD plus is called, then you should have it in minus 40 degrees or something. It should at least be very cold so that it does not get damaged.'s why you should go for a special NAD certified IV bar. And that's so smart for them. Now we're talking about investment models for long life later. You buy a bit of a bonbon. So when you go to the gym, you get your vitamins once a week or once a month, depending on what you think. You have to be prepared to pee a lot afterwards, because you get a liter pumped into your brain. But I'll probably put a little film out of it on our social media. Okay, that was an invitation to entrepreneurs. You should make IV bars with lots of toilets. Then we have the next one. In 2025, one expects that life expectancy, that is, the expected age of life for newborns in OECD, which is a rich country, including Denmark and Sweden, is 90 years old. That's a nice achievement, if that's true. And it is. Then in 2026, a really effective standard tool to find out what people's biological age is. And on that note, there are also some people who have found out by doing really, really over 100,000 tests of people, where you look at the inner layer in the eyes, optically, and then use artificial intelligence to find out how computers can calculate what one's biological age is, simply by taking a picture in the eyes. It's coming. It's 2027. That's smart enough. Then in 2029, someone has put in, there will be an anti-aging medicine, which in any case will solve one of the major age-damping problems. It will be approved at that time. We actually have the Novo blockbusters right now, where you inject anti-fetal medicine into the stomach, and it's a form of diabetes medicine. And I go to the fitness-lunch, which I could hardly recognize her. It's so effective. It's crazy. She just lost 20% or something. It's a game changer. I think it will happen before we agree. It's crazy. I think this falls outside of what I know. I thought you were on it too. The one who who took it all in the course of the week. Yes, but you have to pay and it costs the box. I think it costs several thousand kroner a month, so it's definitely not one that creates equality in health until further. But those who have advice on it, I must say, I was still impressed to see. She is such a handball player and heavy and suddenly she has knee problems longer and she is in a positive wave right now. Back to the timeline, we have that in 2033 a medicine is approved that is based on gall gallbladder, which helps to get a good blood flow. Then in 2033 there will be a country where the expected age of living will be 100 years for the first time. And then in 2035, there will be toilets that test what is falling into them and then tell you if there is something you should be aware of that is not going so well. We have been researching this for 50 years. Right since I started at the Institute for Future Research. It was those smart bathrooms where everything was talking together. And it's like the fridge that also had to order food for you and almost made the notes for you. There are just some of those physical things that come quite slowly. Yes, but it can be that it come on the bars, as you say. Yes, the IV bars, I think. So, there is one here that is quite flipped. There is one that is uploaded in 2036, then we get longevity escape velocity. That that there are people who are young enough to, even if they are ill, the medicine runs faster than their healing process. Meaning that they are always saved from the strain of even better treatments and then they can live forever. It is quite speculative, I would say. What year was it again? It is 2036. So you just have to keep it running. We keep it running. And then in 2036, there comes one that is very flipped. CRISPR is a method for gene manipulation. So there are some researchers who work on, that you can simply take some CRISPR, which destroys DNA in the bad bacteria in the intestines. So it's a very good way to regulate your intestinal flora, I would say CRISPR is a clippage-cluster technique where you can go in and clip into the DNA strands. And you simply go in and change what we are to some people, once and for all. Yes, and then the last one I take is 2050. Some have made a prognosis for the human expected age of life to be 150 years. And that means our very spoiled children will live through the year. They don't deserve it. It's us who should do it. It's a bit of a stupid gift, but we've also had to look at cloning, so in some way we have the opportunity to come back, right Lars? That's right. Where from? WHO expects that every sixth person in 2030 will be over 60 years old. That's about 1.4 billion people, which is enough to population the whole of Germany about 17 times. In 2050, WHO expects that the number of people over 60 years old will rise to 2.1 billion. 426 million of these will in 2050 be over 80 years old. Niklas Brindborg, you are a super researcher, and Lars, you know Niklas from before, so let's tryare you on his way, how fantastic he is. Gobbler, Els Baglunds is his book, which I have had the great honor to write a foreword to. I would like to admit, right at the beginning, I thought it was a great honor for him, but when I saw how good the book was, I thought it was upside down. And it has been sold in 22 countries. And it is a global bestseller. But Lars, still, the fact that you just found Niklas before he became a bestseller, that's what makes you a good investor, right? And what was it you did that you just pulled him out of the mink? Well, I was co-founder of a venture capital fund and I got the idea to have a youth board, an advisory board of young people. And then I had to find the most experienced in Denmark, who were both academically very experienced, but also had a lot of experience and was fully engaged in everything. Niklas had 31 twelfths in the high school. Wow, you are just annoying. He also has a huge head. He is beautiful and he is clever. Now you keep your fingers off. Are you also too? Yes, I am. And I have also written a book called Top Student together with another of our members, Lars Horsbøl Sørensen. You have traveled to 60 countries, right? 80. Yes, 80. So it's a lot of work. Well, now I have to ask you something, because we have some listeners out there who are very curious. And for them, when they listen to you, it's about themselves and how they can live longer or can get their children to live longer. So I'll start by asking you, now you wrote at a very young age about how long you should live. How early should you start to improve your odds? Should you do it in a closed time, like Lars and I? Do you call the doctor and tell him you need to do something, or should you start much earlier? You could say it gets more and more important. The older you get, the more difficult your body becomes, the more you need to take care of it. That's also why, if you're 20 years old, you can go to the city twice a week and still work fantastically. If you're 50 years old and try the same, it's not certain that you can keep up. But many of the things we can see that are the cause of some of the diseases we get later, they actually start quite early. So the earlier you can get into them, the earlier you can, or the better you can get to keep this damage down, which ultimately is what it is. Is that what you call prevention in the health system? Because right now we have a reparation health system, where we catch people when they first become ill, and do you think that could be an advantage, or as a good investment? Yes, I think it will be either on the the public side or from the private side, that there will be a possibility to work more with prevention than we do today. What you have to be careful about is that you don't get too scared and get to denounce yourself with everything you might not have. We can all have a lot of different risk factors that will never be able to determine if you are sick. So if you focus on all of them, it can quickly become very tiring. And you can probably also get sick of it and worry. Then I just talked about the cramps where sleep hasules, where sleep is included in the diet, alcohol, motion and urination. You want to have Kremsø, so loneliness is also included? Or what should we call it? We could also call it Krems and remove the alcohol. Alcohol doesn't make you feel lonely. Yes, that's true. But some studies on how to keep alcohol healthy, as long as you keep it at a certain level, are not very effective. because some of them have received money from the alcohol industry. So in reality the rule is quite clear that the more alcohol you drink, the worse it is. And what about loneliness? Well, loneliness is one of the major risk factors for early death. We can generally see that there are some social aspects that play into it. Also if you ask anthropologists who go to these country cities around the world where people have a very high probability of living a long life, they always turn back and talk about the social connections, the social community they have made the meaning that people find through the social connections and so etc. And we can generally see that people who are lonely die quite early. But the very reason that loneliness is so harmful to one's health is probably that it is a really big stress factor. So we are developed as an extremely social animal, and you can imagine that it is not very smart if you for example walk down the street and be alone. Then you increase your risk of death of all kinds of things, of being eaten, of being attacked by other people. Actually, especially this with when you're alone, you're vulnerable to other people. Back from a time when it was something that could end up with you being killed. So it activates stress response in us, like so many other forms of stress. It's so funny you say that, because I work with future research, and often companies put together a lot of people, and then they have to agree, and then they don't find any ideas ideas because they are in a large group and it is very important for them socially to be accepted so that no one says anything important and everyone thinks they are smart because everyone thinks the same and alone you are lonely and afraid and under a lot of stress so what I always do when people have to find the big trends is to put them in groups of two. Like in diving, you always have a body, but you feel underwater, but you feel up again. And I have experienced again and again, that as soon as you have groups of two, they are mega strong. Now my daughter has started to ride, and it turns out that Icelandic ponies, you should also have in groups of two, because otherwise they crash. And yet we have designed a society where living alone is up to 40%. Yes, and this trend is probably something you can imagine, that it will be even worse in the future, in line with technology, it will become even more our best friend than it is in the past. But this also plays into the two-part of society, which we generally see on Hellbred, namely that it is possible now to have insanely many friends because of technology. It's easier to travel around. You can have friends you meet on social networks and Tinder and everything else. But you are not guaranteed to have any friends. And in the old days, really old days, where you lived on a farm or something like that, then the best parents fit into the family's children. And the big family you were born into, it was always there for all people. And that's gone. And that's why there are far more single people and far more hypersocial today. That's a really good point. One can say that some of our social... some of our advantages of being social will probably come from being physically present. So... there might come in the future different forms of artificial intelligence that can simulate a friendship or even a relationship. And that might help with some of this, almost epidemic of loneliness we have in today's society. But at least on the short run, I don't think we'll get there where it's reasonable before there is a physical connection. So if you want to live long, you need a dog, a girlfriend or many girlfriends? Or many friends? I don't think there's necessarily a... It's more qualitative than quantitative. So it's not because you have to be... Even if you're an introvert, you can have a few close friends, which can be just as good as being an extrovert and having 200 different friends around you, so you can see a little bit. So it's more that you have some quality relationships with people. You have looked at all kinds of different sciences within this, and it must have been so difficult, because there are so many fake news networks in this area. There are so many people who make money by building things up. It's a bit like all the slushies we women have been exposed to in the course of time. What has surprised you the most here? There were some facts about it, where you think, that it's really something that moves in relation to the long life. Well, one of the things that has surprised me the most is how much of what I thought at the beginning was better science was actually a little bit questionable. So there are of course a lot of ways to go wrong in the city, or go wrong in the city with this approach, where you end up taking a therapy that really hurts you more than it does. Can you give an example? There is a good example I use with antioxidants, as we have learned. You should take antioxidants, dietary supplements and... That's what Lars does, right? No, no, that's not it. But you should to take antioxidant diet, and that's something that is scientifically based, there is a scientific theory behind it, and a lot of studies and stuff, but now we have advised people to do this for many years, and we can see that people who take antioxidant diet, they have it with dying earlier than others. These diet pills in scientific trials look like they could promote the spread of some forms of cancer, and they don't help against all the other things they should have helped against. Yes, it's carcinoma, something like getting blood clots and so on. If you just the top 3 of the game changers or the big trends you have in your book, you should give them, because then we'll have to look really far into the future. But if you could just sum up briefly, what are your top 3 tips for long life? Well, the top Your top 3 advice depends on who you are. So avoid smoking, have a healthy weight, exercise and eat healthy. And then you can dive into the details. Isn't there anything funnier? Yes, we talk about loneliness. In the book I talk about being a blood donor, I talk about using a tooth brush. Blood donors, so women have menstruation, that means they have to be blood donors as soon as they go through menopause. We don't know exactly why, but we can at least see that as soon as women go through puberty, they start to age faster than before. Women have a much lower risk of most age-related diseases than men until they reach puberty. And then they start to slowly approach the male level afterwards. So do we risk that women and men end up dying at the same time, or is there some kind of correlation or is there still a big difference between men and women? No, we can see even in other species, even in other species of reptiles, that the male typically lives shorter than the female. It may have something to do with body size, so we can see that the only species where we can see that this is not true, is where the hands of the dogs are just as big. In all the species where the hands are bigger than dogs, for example, men are generally bigger than women, we can also see that women live longer. So better small and strong than big and dumb. According to data from Our World in Data, the global average of expected life age in the world in the year 1800 was about 29 years. In 1950, the average age was 46 years, and in 2019, the average age was 72.6 years. The progress is due to, among other things, radically decreasing child mortality, rising wealth, and medical and biotechnological progress. Niklas, we invited you to the studio because our program looks far into the future. So now I have to have you on a different level than the one looking back, the more speculative one. And we should probably leave you alone or other things if you don't get it right. But what is the wildest picture? If we say 2050, you have heard some predictions from Lars, how far are we living there? How does aging look like in 2050? The wildest fantasy that aging researchers and people who are very involved in aging research have is what Lars describes as longevity escape velocity. To reach a point where research prolongs life more than the time that passes. So if a year has passed, then research has extended life by half a year. So at that point it might well be that we are technically not immortal, so that if development stopped, we would die at some point. But if the development continues, then we could live forever. And of course it's a very speculative thing, if it happens in our lifetime, I'm not sure. But isn't it true that you have changed most of what is written in the study in seven years? Because the cells change all the time? Yes and no. There are some cells in our body, many cells in relation to the nervous system, that actually last all our lives. And then there are some cells. Our red blood cells are replaced every 120 days. Our skin is replaced every day. In a few days, our cells in the gut are replaced. So it's very different how long the different cells last. But in any case, it's a machine. You should be able to renew if you go in. Where do you think the renewal is? Now we're talking about this about the Fidme-medicine. How much will it affect the fact that we will now have a generation that will never be overweight? I don't know if we will ever have a generation that will never be overweight. The problem with this medicine is unfortunately that you have to be on the medicine before it works. So as soon as people stop using the thing called semaglutide, which is the medication we're talking about, then people have to take it all on again. And it's also, now I haven't looked at the most long-term data, but I don't know if you might see a change in the long term, that people would maybe get used to the medicine. Yes, because I think that doing something all your life, I do with my glasses and contact lenses and so on, so it wouldn't be so strange that you took a shot. No, but I think that you might get used to the medicine. The way it works is by being an appetite suppressant. But if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, if now, it is a tiny pill we all get, or whatever, would it change a lot in the age-rate? It would of course change a bit for some, but it is not something like FEDMA or all these lifestyle diseases we are talking about, which in reality are what shortens our lives. What shortens our lives is aging. So if we really want to live longer, we will not be able to do without trying to understand the aging process and slow it down. If you for example imagined that you would relax with all your strength in the morning, then the expected lifespan would only increase by 3.5 years. And then you would die of something else. Because the reason you get many forms of strength is because you have an old body. Lars is jumping up and down. Yes, it's just because in your book and other places you can read about a lot of experiments on for example mice and worms and so on, where you make some relatively radical things, something genetic, that makes them live for a long time. And of course when you read it, you think, we can't get it to ourselves. Can you tell us what technologies you work with there and how the views are to transfer it to people? Yes, there are several different things we work with right now. One of the most recent is what I call zombie cells in the book, or more precisely medicine that kills what is called zombie cells. And if we we take a short look, you can imagine it as some of your own cells that get into a dangerous state, where they just sit and damage the body. You want to remove them, because you can see that if you remove the immune response, they live longer. And there are several companies around the world, especially in the USA, that work on developing medicine that can remove these zombie cells. So that's one thing. Then there are also some more, what you might call moonshots, where this medicine to remove zombie cells is more traditional medicine, where you try to find a molecule and make it into a pill. But there are also companies that work with much more advanced medical technology, which is of course at an earlier stage. Among other things, what is called Alterslabs, where it is in fact on the real plan, that Jeff Bezos is behind economically, and they have then got 3 billion dollars to hunt for a form of what is called cellular reprogramming, which is such a really, really futuristic, futuristic technology, where the best way to explain it is to screw the visors back on the biological urns, and pull people back from their old age to a earlier time in their development. I listened to Liz Parrish, because first I wanted to see if she was dead, all that she had sprayed herself with in 2014, I think it was, where she simply sprayed herself with something that goes in and shortens these telomeres, or... Ext extending them. It's also a technology. Is it something that works? She looks mega young when you google her. What she has done is a self-experiment where she has tried to extend what is called the telomeres, which is something we know that shortening of the telomeres is involved in the aging process. The problem is that there is of course a reason for the shortening of our telomeres throughout life, and that is out that it's because it's a power-enhancing mechanism. So if you can extend your telomere, you can probably quite well stop the aging, but you increase the risk of getting cancer. So of course with the power we have at the current time, it's not a strategy I would use on myself, but you myself. But on the other hand, she only hurts herself. By trying this, we could get valuable data to see what will happen to her. I just want to ask you something here. Statistics say that people who live long have longeromeres. Naturally. No, not necessarily. It doesn't look like people who have telomeres have longer lives. They have a lower risk of, among other things, heart disease, which is caused by blood clots, and they have a lower risk of dementia. And that's probably because it's just the opposite of the allergy. On the other hand, they have a higher risk of cancer, and it ends up, in the end, with some kind of balancing out the two things. Niklas, what do you do yourself? I mean, honestly. All the things I write about in my book, are of my book, I have researched in the first place because I wanted to do it myself. So all the things I write about my book are something I practice myself. Tell me about a daily routine. You start with using toothpaste. What's in it? I write two two places in there that using toothpaste and the first journalist who read it thought it was extremely funny that in a book about a long life I advised people to use toothpaste. So now it's become something that I'm asked about in every interview and I've been sent boxed toothpaste, toothpaste and toothpaste paste and so on. And it's based on something called microbiome. In short, it's based on some studies where they have found harmful bacteria that normally live in the mouth, inside the brain of people who have died of Alzheimer's, but not in those who have died of other things, inside blood clots. They have found other bacteria from the mouth within people who have had a stroke, within the blood clots. And you also know that some of these bacteria can induce something similar in mice and so on. So we don't know 100% what the cause is, is it because these bacteria cause it, but to be on the safe side, it is very easy to use toothpaste so you don't get these infections in your mouth. That makes me want to ask you about something else that Lars was also talking about in his timeline. Fasces transplantations. That is, the fact that you borrow something, I don't know if you should eat others' food or how it works, but, but at least it's the big one. It's like we have all these secrets in our stomachs that we haven't been clear about before. And I think when we get a supercomputer and can cut it all down, is that where it's at? There are some interesting studies in animals, like in some small, very short-lived fish, where you can take the middle-aged fish and remove all the bacteria in the stomach with antibiotics, and then they live longer. If you then take the bacteria from a young fish and put it in the middle age, it will live even longer than those who have just removed it. So you can say that there are probably some harmful bacteria that get caught in our gut flora with age, so it's good to just let them go. And at the same time, we probably lose some of the healthy bacteria that we have in our youth, so it can be even healthier if you don't just remove the harmful bacteria, but reintroduce the young bacteria. So it is also something that is being researched, whether it can be relevant for humans, also in relation to, among other things, obesity and various lifestyle diseases. Something we see is that people have begun to ask for the right to hack their body because they think that the health system is so slow that you just have to get started and they meet on crossroads and it can be really difficult to navigate and the older you get, the more you think, I don't have anything to lose, but everything to win. Is that something you would advise our listeners to just throw out? Or should we rather fast and take some long cold baths? It's not something I would advise people to do in general, if you don't have a great insight. The problem is that now we are talking about many of these things that are difficult to overcome and the hardest thing to overcome is in a situation where you are put in a group of people who can cite some scientific studies and talk scientifically, at least what sounds scientifically based, but if you dive into it, there might not be much hold in it. So it's really a jungle with these things, and you have to remember that when you have something as advanced as the body, it's easier to damage it than to improve it. When you have a really advanced system and then put something random in it, then there's a greater chance that you end up doing it worse than before. So of course there are a lot of fun things to do, but you really have to be sure that the source of your... I mean, there are experiments you can do, but you have to be sure that the ones who advise you on these experiments, they actually know what they are talking about. Sometimes they have a bad opinion, but maybe imagine that they have a little better control over the things they are talking about than they actually do. I gave you one billion dollars and said, here you go, Niklas, you are the smartest of us all. Now you have to choose a technology that you think will lift us the longest compared to this against 2050. What was it supposed to be? I actually think it's pretty interesting. It's basically what Jeff Bezos has done here. He has had solid advisors to choose which area he should tackle. I think they have done a good job. It's the area where if it succeeds, there will be the biggest, most valid effect, it can also be that, like so many other things, it turns out to be a little more complicated than it looked, but there are some interesting muses studies. So this thing called cellular reprogramming is incredibly exciting, at least on the long run. It's something that won't help us right here on the short We need to get more into these more practical things, like what we talked about earlier with zombie cells and so on. Is it mostly tech, artificial intelligence and quantum computers, or is it mostly bio, that you know the cells, or is it a combination? What's the solu the solution for us to get further down that path? It's hardcore biology, it's really hardcore biology. The problem is that you only need to go into cells and manipulate something on a very small scale, very precisely, and just as you want it to be. So especially if you were to design for a therapy, it might not be necessary to get it into all of our 37 trillion cells, but a large part of them. And then again, you don't want just one of these cells or a couple of them to become cancer cells, so you end up getting cancer and so on. So it's really, really complicated. Lars? I'm more and more interested in the zombie cells, because my understanding is that if it actually works, then it's not just that you're getting older and younger, but you're getting younger for a while in reality, because you have these zombie cells it's like if you have a well functioning company then 30% of the employees are totally bored and are singing songs and running around so they are gone then the company becomes more well functioning so if you can remove those unhealthy cells, you will look younger and feel younger and technically younger for a while. When can I get that pill or an IV? Say it now! The problem is that at any given time, even though you are very old, you will have many more healthy cells than you will have zombie cells. So if you design a new drug that only has a small, for example in 1% of the cases, it will damage healthy cells before it will damage zombie cells. So you end up damaging more healthy cells than zombie cells. So it's about being very precise. It's something that's the longest, so it's probably one of the things that fits well to the traditional pharmaceutical industry, so it's definitely something we'll see. The classic, when people are asked about something like that, it's usually said that it will be in five years. It's hard to say if it will be in five years, but there are some positive early studies where they have shown the safety of people, so it's definitely not something you will fall dead with, and it looks like it's effective. I think what I hear is the precision economy we're going with, with precision personalized medicine, where we are completely sure of how the body reacts. Niklas, thank you for sharing with us. Thank you for having me. The research field around longevity works on the one hand with life extension and on the other hand with reduction of biological aging. The scientific consensus is that longevity is not about immortality. It is about living longer by being free from the diseases that cause premature death, or living better through one's age by being free from the diseases that can make old days difficult to get through. But the most radical researchers and start-ups within longevity are moving forward. forward. They see death as an extremely complicated disease that can and must be cured. Well, Lars, what does the investment potential look like? You can see in his book that he is instantly a bestseller. So if you could do some crowdfunding or something else that would convince people that they actually just got a half year in the hat, then I actually think that you had a good investment case. Or do you think that it sounds? There is no doubt that for me at least this area is absolutely something of it for humanity that will have the greatest commercial demand and that is to say whatever really works can become gigantic businesses. When that is said, we have just listened to Niklas and I have read his book, I have read other books and so on, and it is true that it is early days and there is not so much that is investable now, and that is in venture capital. I would still say that all that smart weeks, where we measure and experience fire and all the anticipation that has come in, that you can hear people's voices, whether they are developing corona or those super sniffer who can smell if you have Parkinson's in your cards. All those early indicators that come with better artificial intelligence. We didn't talk much about diagnoses, but diagnoses are probably much easier to get out of quickly commercially, because there is nothing dangerous about getting a diagnosis, there is nothing dangerous about getting a shot or a pill. And there you can get early warnings and there are different things for all kinds of age-related diseases that you can do to reduce the effects or make it go slower and sometimes even completely stop it. So the potential is huge. And it can also be that there are large existing medicinal giants that come up with something. So I would say it's big. It's not like you can buy an ETF fund or something like that now that gives a broad exposure to a lot of these things, but it should probably come. I can also think of those stages with that it becomes mega expensive, this for the health care, because we get all these, maybe this will come, maybe, maybe that, so it's like a hydrant's head. So in the face of these diagnostic tools getting better, we find out that there is everything possible, possibly in the cards. So all of them that say that the more technology that comes, the less we should do, I don't see that. I see a huge pressure on our health care system to respond to all these indicators, where previously we were living in great ignorance. It's a little mixed, if you look at it economically. And this is an economic question, so if we spend 25 years on being children and getting our education and retirements when we are in our 60's, then we have about 40 years where we work. But if our health span, the years where we are well functioning, can be extended, then it can also be turned into a larger percentage of our collective life working. And in view of the work becoming more interesting, and it does in general now, there are more and more interesting jobs, then there are also more and more who actually want to work for more years. So it can also be an economic advantage. And I think, among other things, New Zealand, we're not talking about where we should look, but they have started to make a well-being budget, where they look at welfare budgets and are very agree with Niklas that having a network is crucial, whether you succeed in starting a business, whether you have sweet children, whether you get a job. And then they have suddenly moved some resources from the physical, that is, to go and repair old bodies and restart a heart at 95, to, for example, psychiatry and mental well-being, because they can see the investment case. Another thing that has come from here is that if you for example bike at work, then you emit less CO2, you get better ideas, you become less sick, so you simply earn the state 12 kroner per kilometer you bike. So some pretty funny, where we get a long perspective on the small steps we take in our daily lives. Niklas told me that there is a long way to go. We have to look at 2050 in relation to this with the much longer life and that we live until we are 150 years old. Is that a soft trend? That means that you can choose if you live so long, it requires a lot of effort or is it a hard trend? It's a wild card. All the others will live so long. All the others will just sit on IVs and take cold baths and fast. So that's why you have to do it yourself. So if it's a soft trend, then it's a choice. You can say, I don't want that. I live until I'm 70 and then the others can have it as well. Or is it a hard trend if you are a citizen in Denmark? It's a soft trend because people will choose completely different. There are certainly people who say, I'm just as happy with it. I want to smoke and drink and party and then I have to die when I die. And then there are others who really, really go up in it. So there we will probably see an even larger department in two health care units. So the second question is, is this nice to have or is it need to have? So when we are standing there in 2050 we think, oh, good that I was born right there and not 100 years ago. You know that as a woman, there are many years you would not be born in. Or is it just nice? I think it's just nice. It's not a necessity to have anti-aging. You were in it. No, I don't know. Poverty is relative. So if the others have a party for many years and you're there looking outside, then I think it was a need for me to also have the right to live longer. I get a little tired of seeing those abysses and tweeds traveling around and living forever, while I'm just banging on the glass door or the glass ceiling. Well, we'll move on. Will this happen slowly or quickly when we're out in 2050? We thought, hold on, it's exponential or there were some physical conditions that made people just want to be so busy working with. It looks like it's slow. That's what Niklas says. I think we might start to break through the next five years, but it's still one thing at a time. But at some point, it will probably go away. Is it difficult or difficult to invest in? We've been a bit on the edge of that. Do you still think it's a bit too early? It's a bit difficult, unless you get involved in venture capital in those super interesting startups, which can go completely wrong, but also can go really well. It will be easier later. Do you invest in anything yourself? No, I'm indirectly invested in something called Bella Beat, which is health tracking. But it's not technology in itself that makes you feel better. But of course, if you track your health and your emotions and so on, and your sleep, then it actually helps. It can give you some more years. And is nothing in SUG where you live that you are interested in? Last year a health foundation was established with entrepreneurs and research institutions and so on, who have committed themselves to investing a billion dollars over the next ten years with the goal of increasing the average expected age to 120 years. And that's very close to where we are, so that's interesting. Yes, I also found it a bit curious. Well, then you have to say one word. It's like S, P or K, but here it's rich, sustainable or clever. Clever. Yes, we will be mega experienced if we suddenly get to live until we are 150. I agree. Biological allergy is a relative phenomenon. The oldest person researchers know of is a French woman who was born in 1875 and died in 1997. She turned 122 years old and 164 days old. But in animal history it is completely different. In 2016 a team of Danish marine biologists found a living greenland shark, which was about 400 years old. The shark, which was examined with hyper-modern technological equipment aboard an advanced research ship, was alive when Christian IV was carrying out the round-tower and the Stock Exchange. I hope you have been inspired, but that you can also get your shoulders down now, without getting too much suspicion about all the things you don't try and the things you don't do. We don't know everything, but I have listened to a healthy reason for a very good way forward. And of course, teeth care and good night's sleep. But anyway, thank you very much for this time.

There is at least one researcher who claims he has cloned a human, but has stopped trying when the foster only had four cells. I got three clones out of him. So there are actually three small Nintendos now, and they are extremely cute. And they look like each other on a dot, and look like Nintendo on a dot. So it's extremely fun. This is Supertrends. The show where we curiously investigate all the developments that will turn your, my and our lives upside down. Your host is the future researcher Lise Loned and lived a nice life and got some cute children afterwards. And then there is a number of all kinds of crazy and wild science fiction movies that have made us all somehow have a tendency to clone. And for me, all my years as a future researcher, I've always thought, that's the craziest thing about being cloned. And now we're going to talk about it in this program, and we'll probably find out that maybe it's not that crazy anymore, maybe there have been some even crazier things. In some ways it has become mainstream. Today there are influencers who are cloning their cats and dogs because it is simply a good business case that they continue as part of their own brand. You can pay for that. So with me in the studio, as usual, is Lars Tvede, who has been in the Supertrends machine and seen what it produces on cloning. Then I have a fantastic guest from the USA, Charlotte Jorst, who has in the cloning business and is also a bit of a future researcher and a bit of a designer. So I look forward to listening to her. Welcome! Lars, have you seen Jurassic Park? Yes, I think. I also read the book before the movie came out. The book came out in 1990 and in 1993 the movie came out. It was very funny because the technology described in the book was crazy. But the funny thing was that when you saw the movie, you could make computer animation that people didn't dream of. I can remember that. I can remember especially that one of the eyes has a middle finger where it always says like this. And then you shake it completely and then you know that now there is danger on the way. But Lars, we are looking into a future where biodiversity looks completely messed up. We have these monocultures, so maybe cloning is the way we get it back. What do you think is the most important thing to look at when we look at cloning as a technology? First I would like to put it in a broader perspective in connection with everything that happens with genes. With the new technologies that have been developed recently, there is something called CRISPR, for example, CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas3, it has become much easier to make gene manipulation than before. At the same time, we are also at a much greater understanding of what genes do and what we have. And among them we have found out that humans are actually a cross between a number of different species, so we have got bits of the gene string from about 40 different species that are in our own genes. So I would say you, Liselotte, are really a hybrid between all kinds of different animals and things. And then you also get to know how it normally happens. When you get a virus infection, the virus is running around in our genes. And therefore the virus is actually something that can give us diseases like cancer and so on. But when they run around in the genes, they can also take a bite of your gene and then they get further into... then you sneeze and then you get into some other... that is to say, a bite of your gene can suddenly enter another human. Void? Yes, and that happens a lot between humans, but it also happens between plants and people across the board. But now we have come to where you can create new species, that is, cross genes from different species to create completely new species. And that's something that's going to be very big because you're simply making functional life, so you have to use a special purpose. You can also use something called gene drive to extract a species. Lars, before we start, we have to tell the storks how do you clone, how do you make that identical twin of yourself? Should you have it have a basic foster work or can you just take a little from the skin and try to explain how to do it? There are actually two different ways and methods to do it. One is foster splitting, which is called twinning in English. You enter very early in the first stage of development and then you divide the cells into two. Instead of one individual, two or or more will come out. The other method is that you take the DNA from one individual at a previous stage, but it can also be at a much later stage, and then you move that DNA into a new foster. Jurassic Park was what they did. They recreated DNA. No, sorry, they found DNA inside a mosquito, inside a piece of roe, which was maybe 50-60 million years old. And that DNA they then moved into a bird egg. And the reason for this is that the mosquito has stung a dinosaur. So there is maybe some DNA from a T-Rex in this mosquito. And then it gets into a bird egg and then it becomes a T-Rex. So it's a very extreme way to do it. I think you you clean the egg from your own DNA and then you get this introduced. But it's still wild if we can start getting mammoths again and yes, a dinosaur. Cloning is a technique that researchers use to make a precise genetic copy of something living. It can be genes, cells, waves or whole animals. Cloning also occurs naturally, for example when single-celled organisms such as bacteria reproduce and make exact copies of themselves, or when identical single-celled twins are born from the same fertilized egg that has been divided into two. I could imagine and know, well, are we going to go crazy with making all kinds of strange creations, and there was once? Well, there is already work on it. I must say with dinosaurs that it is like, I already mentioned 65 million years ago, so if you go 65 million years back, so we are simply not able to recreate a DNA that is so old. So so far, it has been estimated that one could go about half a million years back. And the reason for there being some kind of time limitation is that DNA, it seems to be declining over time. But in our timeline, there are actually now some researchers who say they can go about about 2 million years. But there is something else you can do. You can simply take a living species and then start to transform it so that it resembles a previous species. And what we have today and all around us in the world is birds. And birds are descendants of dinosaurs. And there have always been some early experiments where they began to gene-modify birds so that it begins to remind more about dinosaurs. So in that way, you do not mean to recreate an authentic copy of DNA from a dinosaur, but simply by working step by step, you can turn a bird into something that resembles more and more of a dinosaur. The same can be done with step by step and turn an elephant more and more into a mammoth. So it's one of the many things that are going on. And now you mentioned Jurassic Park. There is something on Netflix that I saw recently that was fascinating. It was a mini-series on four parts. It was called Unnatural Selection and it was about biohackers. And that is people who genetically modified themselves and was a caterpillar. One of them had HIV and he modified his genes several times to heal his body and fight HIV. Did it work? No, it didn't work. But he was still alive, and it was a few years ago, so it's possible that he hid it. But there was a little boy named Jackson Kennedy, and he had a gene defect that made him very quickly go blind. And then you see how he gets some treatments that change the genes in his eyes and that make him not blind anyway. And it's extremely touching. And the strongest boy says, what if it doesn't work and so on. But it worked. And then there is such a completely psychedelic fascinating biohacker who is a scientist at the same time. And he is completely full of all kinds of metal jewelry and stuff. But then he goes on a stage and then he inspires himself with CRISPR, which makes him gen-modify a part of his forearm to make it more muscular. And that is by inhibiting something called myostatin, which inhibits muscle formation. And what happens then? The idea was that get a shipwreck underarm. It didn't work out, but in principle it works. I'll get to that later, because I looked in the Supertraining machine on the timeline. There's something really exciting with horses and myostatin. There was also a guy named David Aichi, and he had a wish to make self-lighting dogs, and it didn't work out. But he thought he could combine something from a self-lighting species into a dog gene. That's fantastic. I use bicycle lights when I air dog in the evening, and then you could always find it in the dark. That would be fantastic. And now there are a lot of our programs that are about energy supply, so imagine if you used people as a light object. If we want to be more practical with cloning, there are a few areas that are very large. The first area is to save animals that are about to be exterminated or, as we talk about, recreated. You can clone on something that has died or something where you only know the DNA, you don't even have the cells. I have to ask you, Lars. Would you like to be cloned right before you die, so we can have a little Lars in the world again? It must be the ultimate. Very rich people have always built colosseums and all kinds of buildings and statues so that we, but ultimately, it must be put in the world again. No, I don't have that at all, but I think it could be interesting to clone Newton. And I think he's lying under a church tower. I would like a Da Vinci. Yes, for example. So I could actually be interested in something like that. But there are various projects with the giant panda and the white rhinoceros and so on, where you can actually use this to create more of them and in this way counteract extinction. So counteracting extinction or the extermination or also recreate exterminated species. That's an area. And then there is a very big thing with mammals. And with mammals, there are companies that offer the cloning of mammals. For example, it costs today about a quarter of a million kroner to get your cat cloned. So if you have a cat that you think, this is the cat I want, and when it dies, I will be one identical. And the dog costs about 350.000. For example, Barbara Streisand, she made two dogs, two clones of her dog Samantha, because she was so happy for her. And she had the right to pay for it. There are also some who just get their cells defrosted from the dog, so they can't get it cloned later when they have the right to. Or the cat. We'll hear all that from our guest Charlotte a little later. Yes, because it comes down to the third area, and that is to clone animals that are especially attractive, because they are especially attractive, as elite animals in a way. And that is what Charlotte has done. And what I also find interesting is that now we are doing this, but then there is the whole discussion about the environment and when we do so in our home with our welfare state, then it is because we also believe that the environment can make a difference. And then we actually have some living examples that go around, namely one-eyed twins. It's exactly the same. So when I as a future researcher look at cloning, I think that in any case, the twinning you were talking about, Lars, I think, okay, what is the big investment case here? We have all these one-eyed twins in the foreground, and it's not something that revolutionizes the world in any way, but something you can at least investigate is how much of the egg and how much of the environment. Yes, you use a lot of twin studies for that. A lot of research on the subject is extremely effective because of twin studies. And then we could of course clone a lot of people so we can make the studies better. I don't know who wants to deliver cells to that experiment or if it's ethical or something else. And that's what I incredibly exciting about this program. We can do exactly what we want, but should we and should we? And I know that there are many countries that have a total ban on human cloning. So before we get to the timeline, Lars, have we started cloning people? We haven't done it officially, but what do you think is happening unofficially? There is at least one researcher who claims that he has cloned a human, but has stopped trying when the first one only had four cells. But that was just to find out if it could be done. And of course it's not a guarantee that they would go all the way, but you can do that. So you can't clone both horses and geese and cows and then not be able to clone a human. Don't you think we should use our common sense and say, of course we can clone a human being, but we are not that different? Yes, I think we can do that. And there is already the possibility of making a child with three parents. And it sounds strange, but it is because the mitochondria, which is something that's inside each of our cells, which is a kind of little energy factory, there can be some genetic problems with mitochondria. So you have a natural mother and a natural father, but then you get the mitochondria from another woman who has healthy mitochondria. So in that way you have three parents. And it's super interesting, not least in the family council or the state council or whatever it's called at the moment, that there are now three actors who feel that they have a part in the same child. That should probably give some really exciting discussions. The Super Trans Machine is a dynamic timeline built up by world-leading experts, who in combination with artificial intelligence, give a signal on when the future's groundbreaking technologies will be put into action. Now we're going to the SuperTrend machine and we're going to find out when these different researchers think that the future is coming in relation to the whole cloning technology and the things that follow the results, Lars. Yes, so I was looking at the machine and I made the sentence a little wide because I think that cloning is part of a larger story. So I just gave a selection of the psychedelic things I found. One of our experts wrote that in 2025, that would be very smart, there will soon be the first will be of a previously extinct species. Then we have the same year, so in 2025 still, there are some who make, it is on a sponge, they make an extra chromosome. And they use that chromosome to put different new genes on, which makes this fungus better for making medicine, so it distinguishes something you should use in medicine. You can almost compare it to a genetic app store on the fungus. And again the same year, that is in three years, there will be a functional species, where you have mixed three different species to get more efficiency. Try to explain what you mean by that. You take genes from three different species and mix them together to create a very practical organism. Is it an animal? Is it something I eat? Is it a plant? Is it a building? What are we talking about here? We are talking about microorganisms that are combined into three different species to be optimised. So medicine? Yes, for example. So the year after, in 2026, you are lucky to have cloned a lung. So it doesn't have to be a whole species, but a clone and a lung. And then a person who has a terrible lung disease gets a cloned lung again. I know that you have made a grise heart and put it in a man's foreskin and he lived three months with this rat heart before he unfortunately died. But you can genetically modify the rat so that the human body does not try to support their organs anymore if you have done something like that. So in 2027 you start to be able to buy genetically modified dogs in the USA. And in the whole thing, I think this with the caged animals, it will be huge. Then in 2028 there will be a smartphone app, and again a prognosis from our experts, where you can have your full genetic information. This app will tell you what to eat, how to move, etc. The point is that there will always be new knowledge, meaning that if you only have the full genetic information, then there will be more and more information about how to live your life in harmony with your own genes. It's like a lifestyle thing. Yes, a lifestyle based on precise information about your genes? I have already experienced that with 23andMe, where I kissed and kissed in a glass and sent it away. I got my genes back and found out that I burn 1.8% more than the normal population. So it would be very bad to do a diet where I don't eat anything, but it can really, really well pay off for me to exercise some emotion, because it looks different than the majority. And then we get a lot more insights when we start to be able to translate what is inside us to what should be outside of us. Yes, that's right. And again, what you have done, you do a limited genetic analysis, but afterwards it becomes so cheap that you can do a full genetic analysis that has all the information. And then there comes just more and better understanding of what it actually means. And we actually have something about that with the experts. Also it's 2030, then you think that you have cut everything, all information in human genes, because you don't have that anymore. It's enormously complicated. And what we need to get there is quantum computers, which are able to find out what we still lack to understand. That means you can get full knowledge of all the consequences of your genes, good and bad. I don't know, but I think it's usually like this, the more we get to know, the dumber we get to know about VR. So I have the feeling that when the quantum computer starts, it also shows that there are still some things it can't figure out. Why do we get so small, even though we have the same genetic development? Where the soul is, the flow, humanity, all of these things. We have always thought that now we are born, right now, and now we have the big breakthrough. And then we know everything, and then we can't find more. That's not where we are, right? No, because it's like a lie, where you tell lies after lies. But you're getting really, really far. In 2030, the experts say, there will be a biohacker, like the one I talked about before, Josiah, who will genetically modify his whole body so that myostatin will only be half as effective. That will make the person become very muscular. I could think of being the first one, because given how much I train, I don't think I will look like what I want to be. Do you think you can get taller, like half a meter? I'm not low. What is that? You're not low student, no. And then the year after, there is a researcher who has said that there will be a vaccine... At least not if you are in China or Japan. Well, that was nice to meet you. Hi. Well, but 2031, there is one who has written, 2031, there will be a launch of a vaccine against skin cancer. Then I have to spend all my life in the sun. Then comes one here. This one with skin cancer. If I have to break your timeline and then you turn back, because our guest Charlotte has actually made a new product against skin cancer. It is her second trend. She has spotted that more and more people will avoid the strong sun. What can be developed for that? But you can give a little more time. I have one for her. And that is that there are some researchers in Argentina who have used this CRISPR technology on a horse's foetus, which produces less myostatin, so they become super muscular. And then they have calculated that they can make a horse that can run 80 km per hour. And then when I read this, I saw you, Liselotte, on a horse that runs 80 km per hour. And I just thought my imagination was very funny. Then I come to think that it's not super cool if it snuggles with that speed. It's not that funny when one of your cars that run 250 kmh snuggles into a car because you fall asleep. Yes, that's it. But I have autopilot, so it happens. Yes, you had until one of your friends told you that if you put a half liter bottle in the pipe, it thinks you're holding it. Yes, but it's the same, because there is still no autopilot. I have a few more. This one is quite exotic. Some people use CRISPR to modify human genes, so we live about twice as long, it's 2043. Because they have found out that if you remove a gene in some worms, they live twice as long and people have the same gene. So we try to experiment with it. But it is possible that you can make people who can live for 160 years or something. We should of course also make that program. And then the last one I would say is completely psychedelic. But there is one who has made a prognosis of in 2058, there are some people who are being genetically modified to be optimized to be able to live on Mars. In 1996, the scientist in Scotland succeeded in cloning Ford Dolly. She came to the world in the scientists' 276th attempt at cloning animals and was immediately world famous. But unlike what many think, Dolly wasn't the first animal to be cloned. The title belongs to a halotuss from 1952. What was special about Dolly was that she was the first animal to be cloned from an adult cell. A breast-feeding cell from an adult animal, and not from an embryo. This company sought great progress in stem cell research and Dolly lived a healthy life until February 14, 2003, when she was dead due to natural lung disease. Charlotte Jorst, I am so happy to welcome you. You are a serial author, you don't call yourself a future researcher, but I have always had a lot of respect for you. You's someone who can spot changes in the world and then turn it into a business idea and earn money from it. And it's like you've just got it with you with mother's milk replacement. And today it's of course about cloning. So can you give us a short story about how you ended up cloning the world's best horse? I don't know if he's the world's best, but he's the is the best for me. I did that because I love riding on this horse and we have had so many experiences together. I am not 20 years old, so I don't want to ride on things I don't know if they will get rid of me or what will happen to me. So I clone the one I know. I know how to keep him going. I know what he eats. I know how he is halved or not halved. And then I just thought, I would like to continue with that. And then I cloned him. And how old is he now? He is now 19 years old. Okay. And now he's coming back? Now he's simply coming back. Now he has been cloned this year and I got three clones from him. So there are actually three small Nintendos now and they are extremely dear and look like each other on a dot and's extremely fun. I'm so happy to see all the things you've discussed, what's going on in the environment and how they behave. So far, they look completely identical to the original Nintendo. Also the way they gallop on the market, and the way their eyes look. It's completely unpleasant to see how much their eyes look like his eyes. It's really funny. Charlotte, how do these three keep up? They're doing well with each other. They're doing really well. They're going around the same market. They're actually in Texas at the moment, the horses, because they're not quite old yet. They'll be here at my ranch in about a month. They are six months old. They look like they are having a great time playing with each other. They also say that they are cloning the hukumen. They have very clever eyes. They don't look like other followers. They look like they are clever. I think they behave a little more clever than other followers. They are not running around running around as the others. They can remember the dress and have some phantom memories. It is not as hard to train after seeing them as other horses. It also looks like that, if you look at them on the market. They are so galloped, balanced around. It might be something I imagine, but it looks a bit like that. I have four children. I mean, Smilla number four, who was born, thought that I should have a little afterbirth. And then when she came out of my body and looked me in the eyes, I just saw very, very old eyes. And then I said, okay, I must say, you've probably been here a couple of times more than I have. But that's just what we're talking about. We think we know everything. And then there are still some things that we don't have control over at all, Charlotte. And it's super cool that you're experimenting with this. But I can't help but think that you're also a mega competitive person. Is it fair competition to race a horse that has huge muscles and can run 80 km per hour? Or just, let's say it was Ellen, what's her name, Bolt, who was world champion in sprinting. Can you just say if we could make one of them. That's a really good question. I haven't modified Nintendo at all. The argument for not cloning is that something is always happening in the owl's nest. And therefore there are different reasons for it. They say that when Nintendo's clones come along, it's not the best horse anymore. Then there are others that are much better. But for me it is the same about the horse in itself, in which it is better. For me it is important that it is safe for me to ride it and I know where I can expect myself. So there are different reasons. I really haven't done it because it's the best horse or it will be the best horse. I've done it because it's safe for me to do it, because I know what I'm supposed to do. It's so frustrating when you get a young horse and then you ride it for five years and then it goes half because it didn't have the right physique to be able to handle top sport. Lars is standing there and tripping. He has to ask you about the experience transfer from mother to son or father to son. Was it a male horse you cloned or a female? It was a male horse I cloned, yes. A female? No yes. A female? When you say that it seems like they have some of their father's genes, there is something called epigenomes. If you think of human or animal genes as a piano, then there is a phenomenon where different genes are blocked. And that's something that you, at the beginning, you started to understand DNA, you didn't know it existed. But what you have been exposed to as a little, regardless of whether you are an animal or a human, affects your epigenomes, which means how the genes are expressed. For example, if the parents have been very stressed, it can affect the children psychologically. In fact, I don't know any specific information, specific attitudes and experiences go somewhat further. So it sounds credible that good and constructive experiences like your first Nintendo experience have gone on to its outcome. What do you think, Charlotte? Well, that's what they call it in the USA, it's called Phantom Memory. Where it's some kind of phantom, phantom apparition. And that's exactly how it works. They can't remember specific things, but there are certain things that seem like they have taken with them. Can I ask you about something practically? Can you tell us a little about your experience with doing it? Was it difficult to find someone who could do it? Did you experience routine issues? Was it expensive? I first thought it was insanely expensive, in relation to what horses otherwise cost. I couldn't have bought a foal for that price. Wasn't it 850.000? I think for the three it was something like 81.000 dollars. So it's 600.000. Compared to the number I mentioned for the cat and the dog, it's actually cheap I got three horses for one. Yes, three for one. And that was also because there were three. I think the first one is 65,000, and then the next one is 30,000. And that fits very well. And then I don't know if I got the third one for free. So I paid at least under 100.000 dollars for it. So there is a lot of discount. Yes, a lot of discount. But I think it's incredibly interesting that it's in our repertoire at all. And now I know that you often talk about safety, that being recognized can be an important driving force. And Lars and I thought, well, this cloning, how crazy is that? Because we have inseparable twins in the foreground, and if you don't manipulate genes, is there a market for for it. And we saw that there are actually growth rates of about 19% per year on these cloning companies. They are becoming more and more commercial. And you also talk about it yourself, Charlotte, that if this is really good, then you also have a cute puddle. Yes, I have a little poodle and I live a very, very dangerous life. I fly and drive around and travel all the time. I compete with the horses and I have my business and I'm always on a plane and I always have this poodle me. It has to go through security, it's a small dog. It has to go through the security in the airport and it has to sit still and keep its distance for 24 hours. It has very specific things and it's the best dog I've ever had. So I called the gene company and asked them if they could clone my dog. And they would like to do that for me. Now I get a little discount because I'm the third animal I'm going to clone. So I think I'm actually going to do that too. And then I thought about it, because it's a little bit difficult, because it's expensive. I know you've been told off by your daughters, who think this is the most far-away place you can buy your money from, when there are small stray dogs that don't have a mother or father. And then you do that kind of... I just want to say something about what you just said, because I was smiling when you said it. Yesterday I talked to Liz Lott about how we should take this up. And I said, I have a question for you. Imagine there is a distant planet, a total paradise, and you could think of coming there. The problem is that it takes 10 years in a rocket. Or let's say 50. But then someone says, we say, well, we have a solution. We make a clone of you and then we beam your DNA sequence up. Then they make a clone of you and then you are there. Then we can beat you to death. And that was just not okay. It was something with the outcome, but you can solve that with a chip or something like that. But then you sit and say that you want to have your dog everywhere, but that's simply too difficult. Then you make some copies of it, I think. Charlotte, I would like to give half of of the money. The discount I get, I think I get it for half the price, I give it to the animals. So instead of paying the 375.000, it costs for your cloned dog, you get it for maybe 150.000 kr. and then you give 200.000 kr. And that's a form of well-being, and we've talked about that, Charlotte. But I turn back with you and the future, because you say some crazy things, where I think it's because you live in the USA and not in Denmark. There are two ways to clone entire animals. The first is called embryo twinning. Here researchers share a fertilized egg, which is then inserted into a live mother. Each half will half develops into a unique animal with identical genes. The second method is called somatic cell nuclear transfer. This method contains a specific body cell from an adult animal, a so-called somatic cell. DNA from this body cell is transferred to an egg cell, which has been removed its original core and DNA. The egg cell is now developed into an embryo with identical genes as the donor cell. Thank you for talking about cl being here and talking about this case. What I have to say about you, we have talked about this before, is that you have been very good at catching trends all your life. The reason you can get a horse and a dog and whatever you want without blinking is because you are not afraid of money and you think it's funny and you don't think that when you have a lot of money you take money from others. Can you explain that? I think that money is an indefinable size that is out there in the universe. And those who want to have money can take money. And it's not because if I earn a lot of money that you will get less money. On the contrary, I create a lot of values out in the world, because I employ a lot of people who also get money from my idea. So it's not something that's in some kind of size where there are 3 billion in the world and then you have to divide them up like a cake. No, there is just as much money as you want. You can just see that with Amazon and Bezos, who have created so extremely a lot of money. You can argue whether that is good or bad, but in any case, there is extremely a lot of money for him. And I don't feel that I take anything from others. On the contrary, I create a lot of value. I have a lot of fun with it. I love to make money, but I also love to create things. It's not for the money I do it, but I think because if you really like what you do and if you just go with it with a fresh mind and if you have good employees, then you can create a lot of value for the whole world. And Charlotte, you have that business set again. So first you made a scone for a few weeks, so many people know and sell it for 1.2 billion or how much you got for it.. And I think it's so funny, because then you clone that horse and you sit on the horse and you get skin power. And we've talked about that with Lars here today, that maybe one of the future is that we can genetically modify ourselves out of it. But as long as we can't, it's a huge problem for riders, for golf players. So, in order for you to have fun with the world's best horse, you have to start a new business. Can you tell us about that? Yes, because that was what I did. I was out riding in the sun all day and then I got a very quick skin cancer. It didn't take long. And of course I was extremely sad about it. And the doctors said I had to go back to the office right away and I couldn't be outside. And of course I couldn't do that. So I started to investigate the fabrics and how to do it. I found out that I was actually working in some fabrics and checked it for a couple of years. Then I came up with my new company called Kastell Denmark. It is very successful today. I make very nice, smart clothing that is UV protected. That protects you from the sun when you're in it. Or hikes in it, or golfing in it. There are many who want to be out all are a lot of people who want to look good while they're out. They also want to go to the supermarket afterwards and not look like they're coming from the yoga studio, but that they actually look good or go out for breakfast in their castle clothes. So it's been super successful. If I clone you and throw you around in Denmark, I think we should have a Charlotte both in Fyn and Jutland and in Zealand. Then I'm really interested in doing that thought experiment. What do you think, Lars? If we cloned Charlotte, would they come in workshops, pop-ups, or is it something you have got on your seaweed as a child? What, Charlotte on my seaweed? No, I think if I cloned 10,000 Charlotte, then the Danish BNP would be quite significant. There has been a lot of research on the environment versus the species. And as time has passed, it has changed more and more to the fact that genes mean a lot. And that is what you get from these twin studies, where two twins are adopted into a very well-functioning family and another into a really bad one. And then it turns out to be quite the same. Lars, do you want to have one last question for Charlotte and these cloned horses and dogs? Or should we just invite her back again when they've grown a little bigger? Or what do you think? My question is, would you recommend many people to do the same if they have the means to do so? I can't see why you shouldn't do it. If you're going to buy a horse, it costs the same. So I can't see why you shouldn't try to clone it. God, it costs the same. That's interesting. It's something I found out a few years ago. In Switzerland, where I live, it costs the same to buy scented clothes as to buy stinking clothes in a store. That's because they save money at the store. When you cost the same, that's interesting. Yes, at least. And then you have a much greater certainty that it will still be something you want. So you think you get it as you want it, Charlotte. So if we now throw you, beam you 10 years into the future, the horses thrive, you have three of them, are you someone who can imagine exactly how it will be, or do you take a day off? I always set extremely high goals for myself. And then I visualize that it will probably be like that. So yes, I will do that. Then I will try to give a few words about how it will be. In 10 years I have been to two Olympics. I have been to the Paris Olympics and the Los Angeles Olympics. I have also sold my company for 50 million dollars. How much have you used of the 1.2 billion you have earned in advance? I only have them in the bank. I don't touch them because it's a different kind of money. I don't touch them. But I can have the other money, and then I have started something new. I think I'll try to get a new shoe next time. Charlotte, it has been a great pleasure to talk to you again. You are a great inspiration and provocation and all at once. Thank you very much for being here. A zoological cave in the state of Texas in the USA was copied by the extinct Perval's horse in 2020. The clone was based on 40 years old, crude, preserved genetic material. The Perval's horse is estimated to be the last When I reflect on what Charlotte has said, it seems as if there has been another future. Why do we want to have a copy of something that has been when we have had all kinds of technologies to make something that is much cooler. What do you think? I'll start by saying that it's not a coincidence that instead of taking someone who is super deep in technology, we took someone who uses it here. Because our big question was, what is the use case? And I can 100% understand what she is thinking. She has a limited life. It takes a lot of time to find out if it works with a horse or a dog. Why not, when you have found the perfect thing, get a copy? I can totally understand it. So I think this will grow. That's also what we could read in the analyses. I think we take the cloning of mammals as a focus. Is it a condition or a choice? Because I don't want to take the cloning of people simply from the fact that it is forbidden. Or can we also take that? Or what do you think? Cloning of people will probably happen, maybe also illegal, but it's far from that. It's not a big deal. The cloning of animals becomes gigantic, I think. I think it could be, but it's very much under the radar, so we can't really find any facts about it. I would say that when something is very meaningful to people, let's say God forbade it, that you lose your child in a car accident, so you just got born on the way home from the hospital, a completely terrible scenario. If you then have the opportunity to see that there are some who offer human cloning on the internet, but they don't want to know who they are and you can put your phone number and then you will be contacted, then it might be good to try once again on the black market. Yes, you can't rule that out. I can see that for myself. But let's take the other one, because now we're going through the supertrend round. And the first thing, if we say, the cloning of animals and perhaps also extinct races to get more biodiversity, do you think it will be a hard trend or a soft trend? And the soft trend is where we have a choice to say, I want it or I don't want it. A bit like Charlotte can choose whether she wants to buy a stray dog or if she wants to have her puddle back. Or is it a hard trend, a wild card? Cloning is something we should be aware of. I would call it a soft trend. And number two is, is this a product or a technology that is need to have is, the world comes together if we don't have it, or is it nice to have? I think it's nice to have. You can say that protecting endangered animals and recreating new endangered animals is of course a big thing, but it is a very small part of the total amount of animals and plant species that will come into contact. So, nice to have. And if we then look at the speed, that is, is this one who will quickly turn our society upside down, or is it someone who is a little quiet and calm? I think it's actually quick. Again, the analysis we look at, 17% growth in 10 years is around 100 billion kroner in the world. And then I could almost see that the growth rate increases afterwards, because it's something when the neighbor has done it, then you say, oh, I will also do that. So I think it can be a really big industry actually. And the last one is, is it easy to invest in? There are companies, so now she mentioned herself that she wants to sell your company, so there are private companies that are supposed to be sold, that are supposed to be listed on the stock exchange and so on. It's mostly the venture capital scene, and that's a lot of what we're talking about in these broadcasts. It's some early things, so it starts off with venture capital companies that can primarily invest in it. Don't you think they already make money when they can give a discount? Yes, I think there is a clear business case to make money quickly. And I have to say that it is an American company. I have not heard of any Danish companies that offers this to private companies. The last one, Lars, is that you have to say a single word that comes to mind when you hear all this about cloning. And one of them is rich, sustainable or clever. Like SP or K. Rich, sustainable or stupid? I would say rich and sustainable. And you said I had to say one, so I'll say two. Why do you think it's sustainable? Because you protect and recreate species. Okay, because now I'm thinking about the pigeon. Yes, you're thinking about the pigeon. I would probably say that we could get more. I would just say that with sheep, you find that it's super cool and so on. With sheep, it accelerates genetic development so that you get more effective plants and animals. And that can be very beneficial. Yes, but that's what Charlotte said. You shouldn't clone, you should gen-manipulate. And then we're out of another program. If we take hardcore cloning, you get what you know. And it may not be the fastest thing in the woods, but it's something you know and you're confident in. It's easy and it's a business model. You can also do it with cloning. If all animals perform on 100, there is one that performs 120, then you clone it many times and then they all get up to 120 after a while. So that way it can be effective. That was all we had for you about cloning, and there are lots of ethical dilemmas here, and I don't know where to start and where to end. I think it would be great if there were ten Lieselotters somewhere. Thank you for listening to this episode of Supertrends.
